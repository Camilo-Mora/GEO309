Intro
0:11
so today we're going to be looking at a speciation and extinction basically how
0:16
species are born and how the species die so at the most basic level we have this
0:23
question why species are where they are so there are two possibilities here one is that the species is present you can
0:29
see a species right there the other possibility is that the species is not there so how do you explain a species being present in a
0:36
given place actually it's pretty simple there are at least two basic potential explanations to explain why a species is
0:43
in a given place one is a speciation the species is there because the species was originated there
0:48
or the species got there from somewhere else basically the species originated in another place via migration and
0:54
dispersal it managed to be on a given place that's how you explain at the most basic level why a species is present
1:00
now the only possibility is that the species is not there how do you explain that well one
1:06
possibility is that the species was never there to begin with basically there have been some limitations to the
1:11
dispersal of species that prevent species of getting places and that might help you explain why species are not in
1:16
certain places now the other possibility that you had here is that the species was there but it went extinct
1:23
so you see in biogeography we one of the main things that we had is trying to explain why species are where they are
1:29
at the most basic level you had you had to explain why a species is there or why the species is not there and when you
1:35
link that when you look at the set of possibilities this iteration that is a combination of either a speciation
1:41
species originating in a certain place extinction the species just disappearing
1:46
or dispersal that helps you explain where species is present or not in a given place
1:53
now let's start looking the different components that we just spoke about let's look at a speciation and basically
1:58
is the origin of a new species what we are talking about here is that you start from one species and somehow you ended
2:04
up having two species how that mechanism happens well scientists have come up with three
2:11
different processes in which you go from having one species to having two species okay
2:18
so let's look at the first mechanism it's called allopathic speciation in allopatric speciation you have a
2:24
original population which is a group of individuals of the same species currently a barrier comes along and
2:31
separates that population in two you can think about barriers like for instance you had a valley and then you get a
2:38
mountain in between the two of them now the populations get separated you can also think about rivers for instance for
2:43
certain species rivers turn into barriers that separate populations on both sides and over time
2:50
these populations are separated above trying to adapt to the different environments such that later on if those
2:56
two species come together they might not be able to reproduce and that then results in you having two species so
3:03
basically what we are talking about here is allopatric speciation which is the emergence of a barrier that separates
3:09
populations that over time leads to a species that cannot interfere with each other
3:14
the other mechanism is called peripatric speciation in this case you had a
3:19
an original population and you have some individuals that are just crazy individuals and they just like to go
3:25
other places and basically what these few individuals do is to colonize populations that peripheral to the to
3:32
the original population the dispersal here is very limited right only few of them managed to get to
3:38
those places and this peripatric speciation over time because of the limited dispersal leads to population
3:44
two different species adapting to those places and you you ended up having two species at the end
3:49
parapatric speciation is somewhat related pathway to peripatric speciation
3:55
with the difference that there is a more constant contact between the populations that are emerging at the periphery and
4:02
then you have sympathetic speciation patrick speciation is the the most crazy of all speciations in my opinion because
4:10
in this case you go from one species to the other one to two from one to two species while
4:16
those well that mechanism happens in the same place so basically what happens in sympathetic speciation is that you have
4:23
some mechanism happening in local scales that leads to individuals having some
4:29
type of selection or preference that over time turns into different species
The Beginning of Life
4:37
now that is a speciation let's look at the beginning though of this whole thing about how do you go from the planet
4:44
being empty to now being colonized by nearly 8.7 million species so let's
4:49
start with the from the very beginning though thinking about the time when the planet earth comes to be and that is
4:54
calculated to be in the order of 4.6 billion years so our planet earth
5:01
was born about 4.6 billion years ago then we get the moon the moon came about
5:07
0.1 billion years later so 4.5 billion years ago and basically from the beginning
5:14
of the the beginning of time for planet earth to about 3.5 billion years there was
5:20
nothing happening we're talking about almost a billion years in the history of our planet that nothing is happening
5:26
other than the sinkhole protocol so sometime during this billion years from the beginning of the planet earth
5:33
to 3.5 billion years from now you get this thing called protozoa
5:39
protocell is basically this is structure that works as a plastic bag and the idea
5:44
that the importance of this plastic bag is that it allows for molecules to be
5:49
contained and that protocell eventually came to became the the walls of the cell
5:54
that led to the the prokaryotes that then led to the eukaryotes that then led
6:00
to this huge diversity of life that we had today so for 3.5 billion years
6:05
sorry for one billion years since the beginning of the planet earth most likely what was cooking there was
6:10
this thing called a protocell that is kind of the first the beginning of of what we can call life and the
6:17
significance of this protocell again is that allows to contain molecules that then allow for things to be contained
6:22
there where did life emerge all right so
6:28
one billion years we had to wait since the union of life this protocell is cooking there and then something came along
6:34
that we're gonna be looking in a moment but where did that happen though so there are three potential places where life originated and they are described
6:41
on these papers here one is in western australia the other one in norse northern and
6:46
in north america as i indicate with those crosses there
Parspermia
6:51
now another possibility of where life originated that i find pretty interesting is that most is possible
6:57
that life originated in march you might think this is crazy well it turns out that there is a hypothesis called
7:02
parents frame porn panspermia that suggests that life in planet earth might
7:08
have originated in march and the way that that goes is that today we have encountered several meteorites this is
7:15
one of them that was described back in 1996 and that metaborite that was discovered
7:21
here is actually older than planet earth but one of the things that is interesting from this method is that it
7:27
contains carbon and magnetite and carbon and magnetite are fundamental in
7:33
molecules that are found in life today so the the presence of this magnetite on
7:39
on this in meteorite is an indication that potentially life
7:44
might have come from mars and it's a well it's a crazy idea there is some
7:50
suggestion here to to indicate that maybe the beginnings of life might have
7:55
come from mars again mostly is the presence of this element here magnetite that is encountered in very ancestral or
8:01
primitive forms of life that we see on earth today the mechanism or pattern that explains
8:08
light coming from mars again is called parspermia let's move on now so that's how the
Extinction
8:14
species get originated now let's understand how the species go extends so here if we have the geographical range
8:20
later on we're going to be looking into this which is basically the area where the species is present and we look at
8:26
the size of that area over time what you find is that the geographical range is going to change originally depending on
8:32
the mechanism of a speciation it's going to go then into something that is called an interim phase
8:38
basically their geographical range remains constant and then it's gonna start the geographical range is gonna
8:43
start declining until the point where the geographical range reached zero and that moment is called
8:50
extinction extinction again is when the last individual of a species cease to exist
8:56
well conservation it is very interesting and also another topic of biogeography to understand how
9:03
does this extinction happen how do you go from a species having a geographical range to then completely disappearing
9:09
there are two likely mechanisms in which the species can go extinct one of them
9:14
is what is called outward extinction and basically what suggests is that the species goes in from the center of
9:21
the geographical range towards the periphery and inward extinction is the opposite
9:26
suggesting that the species will esteem from the periphery towards the center i want you to pause this video for a
9:32
moment and think which mechanism of mechanism of extinction is most likely
9:38
most species do wasting from the center towards the edge or from the edge towards the center
9:44
pause the video and think about what is more likely so many of you probably will think that
9:51
the most likely mechanism is going to be inward extinction the reason being
9:57
that obviously the reason that there is a boundary to the geographical range of a species is because the conditions are
10:04
not suitable for the species beyond that boundary if they were suitable the species most likely will go there so
10:10
those conditions are already not suitable for the species so you will think that the individuals they are less equipped to survive as a result the ones
10:17
that are in the middle are very equipped and those ones will be the last ones to extend that's what most people thought
10:22
however there was a guy two guys chanel and lomolino that published a paper in in
10:28
nature back in 2000 that suggested that in fact the the way that most species go stain is from the center towards the
10:34
periphery that was kind of interesting because for the longest of times
10:40
the we all thought that most of the species will go esteemed from the from the periphery towards the center again given
10:47
the fact that on the periphery you are going to have the individuals that are facing conditions are not suitable
10:53
but it turns out that when they when i tested this it was the opposite most of the species go esteemed from the center
10:58
towards the periphery and they use evidence on rodents from australia which is a primitive system they are given the
11:04
fact that australia is a continent that can be easily sampled and what they found with those rodents is that these
11:10
species that when a stem the last individuals left of the species were found on the periphery
11:16
the explanation that they gave in this paper is that what happens is that those those individuals are at the periphery
11:22
of the range are actually pretty tough individuals because they are facing such a harsh conditions they are actually
11:27
equipped to survive better unsuitable conditions so they are the ones that are less to question
11:34
humans had a similar effect as well humans when we go and hunt these species to to
11:40
the break up to extinction it turns out that most of the species most of the individuals that we hunt first are the ones in the middle because those
11:46
individuals in the middle are bigger and more abundant so we want to get the most for the more portfolio or
11:53
hunting so it has been found that humans also enhance this mechanism of extinction by
11:59
us destroying or killing the animals that are in the middle because they are bigger and more abundant and living for
12:05
less than it was in the periphery i want you to take a moment and think
12:10
about why is it important for us to differentiate between our and inward extension why would that make any
12:16
difference why would that be significant for us to know this now you come back from the be from the
12:22
break the reason why this is important is because if you manage to know how the species go extinct then you can
12:28
prioritize locations to protect if the species go esteem outwards then what it suggests is that
12:34
the last individual the la the places that you need to protect are the ones at the periphery of the range to ensure
12:40
that those populations are capable of being maintained longer time potentially replenishing other places but if it is
12:46
inward then you have to perhaps protect the places in the middle and reduce the impulse on the periphery so that's kind
12:53
of the reason why is it important for us to understand how species will extend let me give you some facts about
13:00
extinction this is something that probably you have learned all since probably primary school
13:06
that of all the species the higher existing on the planet 99.9 percent of
13:11
them are now extent so despite the fact that we see a lot of species today the number of species that had exist over
13:18
time is tons larger now when you another interesting thought
13:24
about extinction is that when you look at the historical record of biodiversity
13:29
of life in this planet there have been moments in which you have had massive extinction events
13:35
right periods of time with a lot of species had gone to stem and scientists
13:40
had used something a definition for a mass extinction event as these moments in the history of our planet when over
13:46
70 percent of the species had on esteem again a mass extinction event is generally defined as a moment in the
13:53
history of the planet when over 70 percent of the species withstand it turns out that when you look at the
13:59
historical record that goes back 500 million years there have been five of those extinction events the reasons for
14:05
why so many species afghanistan can be generally described as glaciations volcanism methane releases or meteorites
14:13
that you guys are probably very familiar with even the dawn of the dinosaurs
14:19
an interesting question though if you look at the time record here of the history of life on our planet goes back
14:26
500 million years but we know that the planet earth is 4.6 billion years and
14:31
the first forms of life came out about 3.5 billion years so basically what we're talking about is that despite the
14:37
fact that we know that life goes back 3.6 to 3.5 3.6 billion years we don't know much about
14:44
the history of life on our planet for 3 billion years only the last 500 million years we know something about and the
14:50
question is why why is the historical record of life so sure
Plate Tectonics
14:56
now one of the explanations for why our understanding of life on the planet
15:02
is so so sure only very resin we know about what happened on this planet is plate tectonics basically what what is
15:09
happening here is that all of these surface that we had on the planet eventually was underneath the surface um
15:16
these plate tectonics tectonics and emails so what we are talking about here
15:21
is that everything that you see all the lands that you see today get recycled over
15:27
time there is this very famous paper by base here and johnson that calculated the times of recycling of all of the
15:34
land that we had in the planet and they discovered while there is some variability in among the places on
15:39
average almost all of the places on the planet where you could have had the majority of life get recycled every 300
15:45
million years so basically it's possible that there was an evidence on life on many of these
15:51
places but if it is older than 300 million years that evidence is already gone so
15:58
plate tectonics basically what it does it cannot remove the the biological evidence that it left
16:04
from a species and that is one of the explanations for why the historical record of life only goes back 500
16:09
million years or so most of it the other reason for why the historical
16:16
record is not so because it doesn't go back that far is because the individuals
16:21
are capable of leaving the evidence those ones that create a skeleton are actually not very old so
16:27
when you look at for instance the cambrian explosion that goes back only 500 million years those are the ones
16:32
that start leaving fossils behind and again those individuals are only came about in the history of evolution of the
16:39
planet 400 million years ago on that you had the diatoms that came out 200 million years or the forums so again the
16:45
species that are capable of living evidence came out relatively late in the history of the planet so it's very
16:51
likely that during the trip during the last during the three billion years of the history of the planet that
16:57
we don't know much about not many species might have been here to begin with and they probably just didn't have
17:03
enough evidence to leave behind so as i point out to you throughout the
Mass Extinctions
17:09
for that period of time for which we had a good record of life or the diversity of life on the
17:16
planet we had come to discover that there have been five mass extinction events as i described earlier a mass
17:22
extinction are those periods when over 70 percent of the species is going to stem so you can see here this is the the
17:27
percentage of extinction this is time and as i explained to you despite the fact that the planet the life of the
17:33
planet goes back 3.5 3.6 billion years the best record that we had is 500 million years you look at this record
17:40
you find these peaks on extinction and the reason for these picks of
17:45
extinctions are very diverse like the first one for instance uh the first mass extinction event they happened about
17:52
four four hundred and twenty million years ago and it's probably related to glaciations
17:57
that took a lot of the water from the oceans and as a result the oceans reduced the sea level
18:03
and many of the species that were used to live on the coastlines when extent there was just no no no no
18:09
stratus no habitat for them given the reductions in in sea level that's the second
18:15
largest mass extinction event was the first one to happen the second one and it came about about
18:21
308 million years ago and that is in the late devonian as possibly that it was related to volcanism
18:28
the third one is called the great dime this mass extinction event was brutal these things
18:35
wipe out most of the diversity of life on the planet especially in the oceans
18:41
the reason for why this make this extinction event was so massive is be believed to be related to volcanoes
18:47
somewhere in russia volcanoes start producing a lot of uh greenhouse gases that went and created this runaway
18:54
climate change when the planet heat up super fast the warming of the planet then caused
18:59
all of this methane that is on the deepest part of the oceans so what's happening there is that over millions of
19:05
years all of these sediment rich in organic matter that came from the land went and settled down on the sediments
19:11
on the ocean and it was converted by bacteria into methane it got frozen given the pressure and the
19:17
low temperatures and basically what we are talking about is this massive concentration of methane
19:23
that is frozen in time there now as the air starts warming up these deeper deeper parts of the ocean start warming
19:29
up as well and all of this methane that was frozen in ice it started getting melted and start releasing this methane
19:35
and that accelerated climate change and basically created a set of change of
19:41
reactions that almost wipe out life on this planet this is one of the most concerning
19:47
extinction events because today we see something similar with climate change we as
19:53
warming up the atmosphere with potentially which potentially could unleash all of these alternative sources
19:59
of greenhouse gases that are accumulating accumulated over time in different places on the planet
20:05
this event is called the great dime as i indicated to you over 96 percent of the species on the
20:12
oceans were when esteemed because of this guy here the forest mass extinction potentially
20:17
related to volcanoes as well and the last one that we almost likely know was the dome of the dinosaurs and we know
20:24
relatively very well right now that that extinction was triggered by a meteorite so
20:30
scientists looking for this meteorite came to find that this met terrorite hit somewhere in the gulf of mexico and
20:37
it has been very interesting you study the physics of these impacts it turns out that the significance of the impact was because
20:43
it hit the planet in a diagonal matter i don't really remember very well how that influences but it turns out
20:50
that the difference between this method and having such a huge effect was related mostly to the inclination in
20:56
which it hit the planet today people keep talking about this
21:02
huge extension of a species driven by humans and a question that has been posed are we now on a mass extinction
21:08
event okay as i explained to you mass extinction is when over 70
21:13
or more other species go stain so today we are not in a mass extinction event
21:18
however there are several papers pointing out that we are in our way there
21:23
so again when when you look at the species that had gone and stained in recent times only about one to two percent of
21:30
the species had gone and stained that we had a record for and we're gonna see later on that this is not really a
21:35
reliable indicator of how bad things are i'm gonna go to that in a moment however when you look at
21:41
what's happening to a species you see that many species are declining and that's the thing that is concerning and
21:47
again why we start foreseeing the presence of a mass extinction event on the horizon
21:54
given how fast many of these species are declining so the first
21:59
paper to document this idea of us being on the verge of a mass extinction event
22:05
was by this guy calvin barnoski and what he did here he took different groups of a
22:10
taxa and in here you can see the this black line represents what is defined as
22:15
a mass extinction event again when 70 or more of the species goes staying here in this specific case he used 75 percent as
22:22
a threshold and he indicates here the file then the fight that we know of one two three four and five
22:27
but then he sees what is happening today and what you see here are the species that are critically
22:32
endangered today those are the species that are the brick of extinction and as you can see if all of these species were
22:38
stained which is very likely given the fact that the arms are the brick they still don't reach that threshold of 75
22:44
percent the critical part though is when you analyze and the species are endangered or
22:51
vulnerable when you analyze species are in danger or vulnerable those are species that are today at the
22:57
start of this declining pathway so if you extrapolate the decline of these
23:02
species until the point that they question then it's very likely that you analyze all of those species by 2100
23:09
all of these species are currently in danger and vulnerable will accumulate to create a
23:14
way beyond what is a mass extinction event so again this is one of the pieces
23:20
of evidence that you can use to suggest that there is a mass extinction event on the way because again many species are declining
23:26
quite dramatically and you analyze the species that are today critically endangered endangered or vulnerable
23:32
eventually we are going to make it to that threshold off a mass extinction event
23:37
this is another paper that can be used to describe whether we are in a mass extinction event this paper was actually
23:43
a paper from my laboratory that we published in the journalist science in 2013 what we did on that paper was this
23:49
so here you take the number of species as a percentage so it could be five million eight million who knows doesn't
23:55
really matter for the purpose of this analysis and here we had time what we did on this paper was to mark what we
24:01
define as a mass extinction event right basically when over 75 percent of the species went stem
24:08
so what we did for this paper though was to compile
24:13
all the rays of extinctions from many different papers we took a bunch of papers that had reported extinction of
24:19
species and those rays of extinctions range from 0.72 percent per year to 0.22
24:26
per year and what we did then we took this number of species one percent and we start driving them extend by these
24:31
percentages and basically what we did is to calculate these scenarios of at this rate of extensions when are we going to
24:38
go to cross this stressful of what we call a mass extinction event and the number came to be sometime in the next century
24:46
so this is again another way to analyze the data that allows you to support the idea
24:51
that sometime in the next few decades we are going to be crossing a mass extinction event and what i want you to realize is
24:57
that in the past those mass extinction events had taken thousands of years to develop we are
25:02
talking about 100 200 years in which we actually push the life on the planet to to those
25:08
stressful that it has taken millions of years before just for you to realize the significance of what we're doing to our
25:13
planet today another thing that we did on this paper was to calculate the number of species
25:20
that are being described every year so today we only know about 20 of these species that live in the planet we are
25:26
describing on the ray of 8 000 species a year so what it means is that if we continue to describe species at a rate
25:32
of 8 000 per year you can see all of these species are still undescribed all of these species
25:38
that are going to stain we don't know the names for them so basically what we are
25:44
talking that we described on this paper is that many of these species are going to stain without us even knowing their
25:49
names without us even even giving them a name that's the ray of which where the
25:55
driving species to extinction today here are some examples used for you to
26:00
put faces to these numbers of the ray of extinction here we had the tasmanian tiger
26:06
this species was used to live in tasmania for four million years this is the area where it was restricted to
26:12
unfortunately humans go to that place and there was a conflict between then eating what we eat and in seriously 200
26:19
years we wipe out that species from the face of the planet this is the last thing you are left i
26:25
want you to look at that guy man this is the last guy of the tasmanian tiger he was kept in a zoo in tasmania there
26:33
and he he was kept in captivity and the animal died exactly on september 7 or
26:38
1936. a few years later six years earlier in 1930 the while the wild version of these
26:46
animals was hanging out somewhere in the field somebody took a gun and shoot the guy so imagine that we had the record of
26:53
exactly the last time that we killed the last individual that was in the wild 36 years later
27:00
this one guy died in the zoo and when these animals died the whole species
27:05
will sting what i want you to look is look at the desperation of that animal man can you imagine you being the last
27:10
individual left there is nobody that you can share the planet with you despite the fact that you had owned your right
27:16
to be on this planet like every other species and he was asked in just 200 years to wipe out that species
27:22
now what is super sad about this species is that the last individual as i
27:28
explained to you died in 1936 and in that year the government of
27:34
tasmania introduced law to protect the species can you imagine how
27:39
like this is like a joke you know the year in which the species goes sustained is when we all get
27:45
concerned to protect the species when it's already way too late so that species when it's
27:50
laws to protect that species were introduced the year when the last thing we will die
Western Black Rhino
27:57
so here is another species this is a western black rhino it was used to live in africa for 50 million years this is
28:03
the part where it was used to live there were time records in which the populations were estimated to be in the
28:08
order of a hundred thousand individuals for some reason for some kind of sick reason
28:15
at least with the tasmanian tiger it was basically we were the animal was eating what we eat but in this case we just
28:22
somehow got an appetite for the horns of this animal that's sick and basically what happened is that in
28:29
just 40 years since since we created a trade value for
28:34
the homes of this animal the species went extinct and unfortunately we had an actual
28:39
scientific record of the time when when the last time that we saw it was in 2006
28:46
and it was the clearest thing in the world in 2011.
Golden Toad
28:51
here is another guy that went to steam this is the golden toad though this animal was used to live in south america
28:58
for 60 million years can you imagine like being on a place for 65 million years until somebody come along and
29:04
destroy your habitat in this case the reason why this guy went to steam
29:10
was because of climate change it turns out that there were many
29:15
elevations high elevations where the frogs managed to survive from this fungi
29:22
that kills them and this fungi couldn't reach higher elevations because it was too cold but as climate change started
29:28
increasing the temperature of those higher elevations he expanded the geographical range of these fungi so
29:34
basically these stoves run out of space that they could escape the fungi and
29:39
eventually in just 30 years the species went again the last time that we saw this a golden
29:47
toad was in 1889 and finally we decided to declare the species of sting in 1982
Caribbean Monk Seal
29:55
this is another one this is the caribbean monk seal this is another one that is very interesting so when
30:00
christopher columbus got to the caribbean they estimated that the total population of this species was 250 000 individuals
30:08
there were tons of these in the world christopher columbus when he gets to the caribbean he grabs his own in his
30:13
logbook that there are so many of these animals that they covered completely the beaches and sometimes you have to push
30:19
his animals away can you imagine going from that level of density to a species going completely extinct
30:26
in this case the reasons why we kill this animal was to feed on their on their meat but also
30:31
to use their their their fat to to to so that we can see at night can you imagine
30:37
eventually the the entire species was driven to extinction in just 300 years
30:43
since the time that it came in upon contact with people to the time that we drove that species to extinction it was
30:49
300 years the last time that somebody saw that species was in 1952 and again another
30:56
sarcasm i believe here was that people decided to start protecting the law in 1967
31:02
and it was declared in 1967 and the species was declared in 2009 i want you to realize these numbers
31:08
though this one is even sadder because the species was probably already extinct when we decided to
31:14
to create laws to protect the species so that's the tail here of the monsieur
Species
31:21
but there are hundreds of those species this is species when it's in in 1981 here we had 1970 the caspian tiger 1970
31:30
here this guy 1989 this one here still in 2000 that one in 2003 ambassador this
31:38
one 2004 2008 2011 man i started getting the
31:43
goosebumps i have been giving this presentation for so many years and every time that i give this presentation i get
31:48
freaking good sponsors man just to realize the craziness of what we are doing to our planet this species in 2011
31:55
1941 1900s esteem in 1980 many of these species
32:01
that are going to stand even this one's called lucky that at least we took a photograph of them many species are going to stain and we don't even have a
32:06
photo nor a name for them 20 000 species could be easily going to stain every year because of what we do
32:13
to our planet now unfortunately
32:19
describing claiming extinction is very hard for a scientist saying that a
32:24
species is a sting is very hard the reason being that as the species start declining
32:32
the few individuals that are left become rare so it's possible in fact that with
32:37
the last time that we see individuals there might be some time after in which the individuals are against so rare we
32:42
don't see them and eventually it might take a while for the species to question from the time that we last in an example
32:47
is this guy here the johnson river dolphin it's a beautiful
32:53
mammal from the johnson river there's a pretty cool story about this guy and
33:00
in china but basically what happens was that the last time that we saw this dolphin was in 2002 yet in 2006
33:09
four years later somebody took a video recording of the river and something came out on the surface of the river
33:15
that seems to look like a dolphin because of that footage that doesn't necessarily confirm that the dolphin was
33:22
still there we failed to declare this species esteem and again even to this day there is
33:28
still controversy whether this animal is sustained or not and the reason why
33:33
a is controversial for a scientist to put an uh uh to put a date when the species
33:39
goes sustained is the fact that we might be wrong in the sense that again when the species decline they
33:45
became they become so rare that we don't see them so based on the fact that we
33:50
saw them last is not necessarily a good indication that the species is not there despite the fact that
33:55
it reflects a reality that the species might be at the brick of extinction
When do we declare a species rare
34:00
so as a result one of the key questions in biogeography is when do we declare a species esteem that is something that
34:06
we're constantly struggling with so that people can better appreciate the significance of what we are doing
34:12
let me just give you an example on a paper that tried to address this question was a paper by andrew solo and
34:18
one of his students looking at the dodo this species was used to live in mauritius island in the indian ocean
34:25
the last time that somebody saw this species was in 1662
34:30
okay but as i explained what happens when the species is declining is the fact that
34:36
they don't become rare so it becomes harder to find them so you might necessarily
34:41
the species might still be there despite the fact that you might not see it so what they did they took all of the
34:47
sightings of the species up to 1662 and they created a distribution of the time
34:52
that it might take for the species to go esteem and basically what they managed to to
34:57
calculate was that this species probably wasn't in 1690 so again the last time that we saw it
35:04
was in 62 possibly when it's seen 30 years later so what they claim on this paper which
35:10
is in the journal nature is that in this case example it took about 30 years from
35:15
the time that we last saw a species to the time that it went stain and that again poses a huge
35:22
concern for many of the species that today had become so rare that we had no seed and possibly already a steam but in
35:28
scientists we got away and according to this paper we gotta wait 30 years for us to be able to finally claim that the
35:33
species question at which time it's already too late as we demonstrated with those case examples
35:39
so that is one of the concerns of us trying to to to highlight the significance of
35:46
the environmental crisis based on extinction is the fact that extinction is very hard to document scientifically
Probability of Extinction
35:54
so rather than saying when a species question there are other metrics that
36:00
have been trying to highlight the significance of the all the status of some species one of that
36:06
is what is called the probability of extinction which is a paper by nick dolby and in this paper
36:12
basically they had a mathematical equation i don't really want us to go into the specifics of it but basically what you do is given the times when the
36:19
species has been recorded you can then calculate the probability that the species is
36:24
speciesist in this one example for instance of the of the surgeon here they estimated that
36:30
this species there is an 85 chance that the species is esteemed again you are interested in the equation it's pretty
36:36
straight forward to calculate here i don't want you to pay attention to it other than knowing that there is an alternative way that rather than us in a
36:43
species of sting we can rather say a probability that the species stings so when you say that it's a 95 percent
36:48
chance of that the species going to stay and that already kind of reveals the that that species is likely facing
Time of Extinction
36:56
another metric is what we what is called the time of extinction this is done by a colleague of mine christine where basically we
37:02
published this paper together back in 2010 and some other professors that were qualities on this paper what we did in
37:08
this paper what christina did was to look at the declines of species that we
37:13
see today and extrapolate that decline to then calculate eventually when does the density of this species reach zero
37:20
and from today to the time that the density reached zero then you can calculate that time and you can come up
37:25
with an index that is called the time to extinction again another metric that highlights the significance of the
37:31
crisis for many species now another interesting question about
Time of Recovery
37:38
geography when you look at the history of ortana is to identify how long it has taken the planet to recover from those
37:44
distinctions and there is a very interesting paper here by kerner and well in nature in 2002 so in this paper
37:49
they had two interesting plots one looking at the extension and as you see as we described earlier there
37:56
have been five mass extinction events one two three four and five but then the
38:02
other interesting plot of that paper is the ray of origination on new species obviously when a lot of species go
38:07
extinct and the conditions go back to normal there's a lot of space where species can originate and what they did
38:14
was to look at the patterns of origination and what they found was this very interesting pattern that for every
38:19
peak of extinction there is a peak of origination you can see the case here high extension high
38:25
origination high extension high origination high extension high origination so what that suggests is
38:32
that the planet heals of all these mass extinction events that have happened in the planet before the
38:37
planet has managed to heal and life comes back from this the interesting the
38:43
cash though is that it has taken 10 million years on average for the planet to recover from these mass extinction
38:49
events and that is another huge indication of how bad it is what we are doing to our planet today which is the
38:55
fact that it could take easily 10 million years for the planet to heal from what we are doing to it
39:02
i'm going to finish out this class by pointing out something that i find interesting about
39:09
what is to come once we start driving so many species a stent and there is this tail based on this tiny island easter
39:16
island in the middle of the lower pacific and what happens there is that 300
39:21
sometimes sometimes 300 to 1200 years
39:26
after jesus was born the polynations colonized that island right they got there
39:33
at the time that they get to this island yeah i can't you can imagine this right these guys get there in a in the canoes
39:38
get there and there is this beautiful island colonized with 20 21 species of
39:44
trees and multiple species of birds and they were the oceans there so
39:50
interestingly though for multiple reasons these people start
39:55
destroying their landscape okay no criticism there so if any of you is a pollination that
40:00
is from the place please don't take offense on this i'm just describing this example in which the people destroy
40:07
the biodiversity on those places again for multiple reasons one possibility is the fact that they use a lot of the
40:13
trees to build these huge structures that are left today it's possible maybe that they build this thing in a way to
40:20
pray to god to help them not to go esteem after they start seeing the end coming
40:25
but the matter of the fight was though that they cut down all of the trees and unfortunately they brought a lot of rats
40:31
with them and this combination of us cutting the trees and and us having
40:36
these pets that eat the seeds that were introduced by us as well led to basically a process in which the
40:43
populations that were there were being disappearing faster than they were able to replenish so imagine this thing we
40:49
were hitting this species these populations on both ends on one end we
40:54
were killing the adults cutting down the trees and on the other end we introduced these rats that were eating the seeds so
41:00
these trees and this biodiversity on this island just had no choice
41:06
as a result many of these species on that island were stained now what is
41:11
interesting is when you look at the number of people on that island the number of people got to be all the
41:17
way up to 10 000 people and then it just collapsed super fast right so what it happened
41:24
there you this is a very interesting documentary on this in national geographic when they ran out of
41:30
a species on land they could they didn't have a wood to build boats so all these fish
41:37
that were there they couldn't catch they couldn't go and get them so basically no good no boats no fishing there was no
41:42
escape those people could trap on this island ten thousand of them so basically a game that ran out of food and
41:48
internationally it ended up eating each other there so there is record of cannibalism happening on this
41:54
island again just for you to highlight the significance of what it is as destroying the capacity of the land to
42:00
produce basic things like foods exactly what we are doing today but a much larger scale just like a tiny version
42:09
again of what we are doing to our planet i just want to finish up the class by saying that extinction is in seriously
42:17
=======

Intro
0:11
so today we're going to be looking at a speciation and extinction basically how
0:16
species are born and how the species die so at the most basic level we have this
0:23
question why species are where they are so there are two possibilities here one is that the species is present you can
0:29
see a species right there the other possibility is that the species is not there so how do you explain a species being present in a
0:36
given place actually it's pretty simple there are at least two basic potential explanations to explain why a species is
0:43
in a given place one is a speciation the species is there because the species was originated there
0:48
or the species got there from somewhere else basically the species originated in another place via migration and
0:54
dispersal it managed to be on a given place that's how you explain at the most basic level why a species is present
1:00
now the only possibility is that the species is not there how do you explain that well one
1:06
possibility is that the species was never there to begin with basically there have been some limitations to the
1:11
dispersal of species that prevent species of getting places and that might help you explain why species are not in
1:16
certain places now the other possibility that you had here is that the species was there but it went extinct
1:23
so you see in biogeography we one of the main things that we had is trying to explain why species are where they are
1:29
at the most basic level you had you had to explain why a species is there or why the species is not there and when you
1:35
link that when you look at the set of possibilities this iteration that is a combination of either a speciation
1:41
species originating in a certain place extinction the species just disappearing
1:46
or dispersal that helps you explain where species is present or not in a given place
1:53
now let's start looking the different components that we just spoke about let's look at a speciation and basically
1:58
is the origin of a new species what we are talking about here is that you start from one species and somehow you ended
2:04
up having two species how that mechanism happens well scientists have come up with three
2:11
different processes in which you go from having one species to having two species okay
2:18
so let's look at the first mechanism it's called allopathic speciation in allopatric speciation you have a
2:24
original population which is a group of individuals of the same species currently a barrier comes along and
2:31
separates that population in two you can think about barriers like for instance you had a valley and then you get a
2:38
mountain in between the two of them now the populations get separated you can also think about rivers for instance for
2:43
certain species rivers turn into barriers that separate populations on both sides and over time
2:50
these populations are separated above trying to adapt to the different environments such that later on if those
2:56
two species come together they might not be able to reproduce and that then results in you having two species so
3:03
basically what we are talking about here is allopatric speciation which is the emergence of a barrier that separates
3:09
populations that over time leads to a species that cannot interfere with each other
3:14
the other mechanism is called peripatric speciation in this case you had a
3:19
an original population and you have some individuals that are just crazy individuals and they just like to go
3:25
other places and basically what these few individuals do is to colonize populations that peripheral to the to
3:32
the original population the dispersal here is very limited right only few of them managed to get to
3:38
those places and this peripatric speciation over time because of the limited dispersal leads to population
3:44
two different species adapting to those places and you you ended up having two species at the end
3:49
parapatric speciation is somewhat related pathway to peripatric speciation
3:55
with the difference that there is a more constant contact between the populations that are emerging at the periphery and
4:02
then you have sympathetic speciation patrick speciation is the the most crazy of all speciations in my opinion because
4:10
in this case you go from one species to the other one to two from one to two species while
4:16
those well that mechanism happens in the same place so basically what happens in sympathetic speciation is that you have
4:23
some mechanism happening in local scales that leads to individuals having some
4:29
type of selection or preference that over time turns into different species
The Beginning of Life
4:37
now that is a speciation let's look at the beginning though of this whole thing about how do you go from the planet
4:44
being empty to now being colonized by nearly 8.7 million species so let's
4:49
start with the from the very beginning though thinking about the time when the planet earth comes to be and that is
4:54
calculated to be in the order of 4.6 billion years so our planet earth
5:01
was born about 4.6 billion years ago then we get the moon the moon came about
5:07
0.1 billion years later so 4.5 billion years ago and basically from the beginning
5:14
of the the beginning of time for planet earth to about 3.5 billion years there was
5:20
nothing happening we're talking about almost a billion years in the history of our planet that nothing is happening
5:26
other than the sinkhole protocol so sometime during this billion years from the beginning of the planet earth
5:33
to 3.5 billion years from now you get this thing called protozoa
5:39
protocell is basically this is structure that works as a plastic bag and the idea
5:44
that the importance of this plastic bag is that it allows for molecules to be
5:49
contained and that protocell eventually came to became the the walls of the cell
5:54
that led to the the prokaryotes that then led to the eukaryotes that then led
6:00
to this huge diversity of life that we had today so for 3.5 billion years
6:05
sorry for one billion years since the beginning of the planet earth most likely what was cooking there was
6:10
this thing called a protocell that is kind of the first the beginning of of what we can call life and the
6:17
significance of this protocell again is that allows to contain molecules that then allow for things to be contained
6:22
there where did life emerge all right so
6:28
one billion years we had to wait since the union of life this protocell is cooking there and then something came along
6:34
that we're gonna be looking in a moment but where did that happen though so there are three potential places where life originated and they are described
6:41
on these papers here one is in western australia the other one in norse northern and
6:46
in north america as i indicate with those crosses there
Parspermia
6:51
now another possibility of where life originated that i find pretty interesting is that most is possible
6:57
that life originated in march you might think this is crazy well it turns out that there is a hypothesis called
7:02
parents frame porn panspermia that suggests that life in planet earth might
7:08
have originated in march and the way that that goes is that today we have encountered several meteorites this is
7:15
one of them that was described back in 1996 and that metaborite that was discovered
7:21
here is actually older than planet earth but one of the things that is interesting from this method is that it
7:27
contains carbon and magnetite and carbon and magnetite are fundamental in
7:33
molecules that are found in life today so the the presence of this magnetite on
7:39
on this in meteorite is an indication that potentially life
7:44
might have come from mars and it's a well it's a crazy idea there is some
7:50
suggestion here to to indicate that maybe the beginnings of life might have
7:55
come from mars again mostly is the presence of this element here magnetite that is encountered in very ancestral or
8:01
primitive forms of life that we see on earth today the mechanism or pattern that explains
8:08
light coming from mars again is called parspermia let's move on now so that's how the
Extinction
8:14
species get originated now let's understand how the species go extends so here if we have the geographical range
8:20
later on we're going to be looking into this which is basically the area where the species is present and we look at
8:26
the size of that area over time what you find is that the geographical range is going to change originally depending on
8:32
the mechanism of a speciation it's going to go then into something that is called an interim phase
8:38
basically their geographical range remains constant and then it's gonna start the geographical range is gonna
8:43
start declining until the point where the geographical range reached zero and that moment is called
8:50
extinction extinction again is when the last individual of a species cease to exist
8:56
well conservation it is very interesting and also another topic of biogeography to understand how
9:03
does this extinction happen how do you go from a species having a geographical range to then completely disappearing
9:09
there are two likely mechanisms in which the species can go extinct one of them
9:14
is what is called outward extinction and basically what suggests is that the species goes in from the center of
9:21
the geographical range towards the periphery and inward extinction is the opposite
9:26
suggesting that the species will esteem from the periphery towards the center i want you to pause this video for a
9:32
moment and think which mechanism of mechanism of extinction is most likely
9:38
most species do wasting from the center towards the edge or from the edge towards the center
9:44
pause the video and think about what is more likely so many of you probably will think that
9:51
the most likely mechanism is going to be inward extinction the reason being
9:57
that obviously the reason that there is a boundary to the geographical range of a species is because the conditions are
10:04
not suitable for the species beyond that boundary if they were suitable the species most likely will go there so
10:10
those conditions are already not suitable for the species so you will think that the individuals they are less equipped to survive as a result the ones
10:17
that are in the middle are very equipped and those ones will be the last ones to extend that's what most people thought
10:22
however there was a guy two guys chanel and lomolino that published a paper in in
10:28
nature back in 2000 that suggested that in fact the the way that most species go stain is from the center towards the
10:34
periphery that was kind of interesting because for the longest of times
10:40
the we all thought that most of the species will go esteemed from the from the periphery towards the center again given
10:47
the fact that on the periphery you are going to have the individuals that are facing conditions are not suitable
10:53
but it turns out that when they when i tested this it was the opposite most of the species go esteemed from the center
10:58
towards the periphery and they use evidence on rodents from australia which is a primitive system they are given the
11:04
fact that australia is a continent that can be easily sampled and what they found with those rodents is that these
11:10
species that when a stem the last individuals left of the species were found on the periphery
11:16
the explanation that they gave in this paper is that what happens is that those those individuals are at the periphery
11:22
of the range are actually pretty tough individuals because they are facing such a harsh conditions they are actually
11:27
equipped to survive better unsuitable conditions so they are the ones that are less to question
11:34
humans had a similar effect as well humans when we go and hunt these species to to
11:40
the break up to extinction it turns out that most of the species most of the individuals that we hunt first are the ones in the middle because those
11:46
individuals in the middle are bigger and more abundant so we want to get the most for the more portfolio or
11:53
hunting so it has been found that humans also enhance this mechanism of extinction by
11:59
us destroying or killing the animals that are in the middle because they are bigger and more abundant and living for
12:05
less than it was in the periphery i want you to take a moment and think
12:10
about why is it important for us to differentiate between our and inward extension why would that make any
12:16
difference why would that be significant for us to know this now you come back from the be from the
12:22
break the reason why this is important is because if you manage to know how the species go extinct then you can
12:28
prioritize locations to protect if the species go esteem outwards then what it suggests is that
12:34
the last individual the la the places that you need to protect are the ones at the periphery of the range to ensure
12:40
that those populations are capable of being maintained longer time potentially replenishing other places but if it is
12:46
inward then you have to perhaps protect the places in the middle and reduce the impulse on the periphery so that's kind
12:53
of the reason why is it important for us to understand how species will extend let me give you some facts about
13:00
extinction this is something that probably you have learned all since probably primary school
13:06
that of all the species the higher existing on the planet 99.9 percent of
13:11
them are now extent so despite the fact that we see a lot of species today the number of species that had exist over
13:18
time is tons larger now when you another interesting thought
13:24
about extinction is that when you look at the historical record of biodiversity
13:29
of life in this planet there have been moments in which you have had massive extinction events
13:35
right periods of time with a lot of species had gone to stem and scientists
13:40
had used something a definition for a mass extinction event as these moments in the history of our planet when over
13:46
70 percent of the species had on esteem again a mass extinction event is generally defined as a moment in the
13:53
history of the planet when over 70 percent of the species withstand it turns out that when you look at the
13:59
historical record that goes back 500 million years there have been five of those extinction events the reasons for
14:05
why so many species afghanistan can be generally described as glaciations volcanism methane releases or meteorites
14:13
that you guys are probably very familiar with even the dawn of the dinosaurs
14:19
an interesting question though if you look at the time record here of the history of life on our planet goes back
14:26
500 million years but we know that the planet earth is 4.6 billion years and
14:31
the first forms of life came out about 3.5 billion years so basically what we're talking about is that despite the
14:37
fact that we know that life goes back 3.6 to 3.5 3.6 billion years we don't know much about
14:44
the history of life on our planet for 3 billion years only the last 500 million years we know something about and the
14:50
question is why why is the historical record of life so sure
Plate Tectonics
14:56
now one of the explanations for why our understanding of life on the planet
15:02
is so so sure only very resin we know about what happened on this planet is plate tectonics basically what what is
15:09
happening here is that all of these surface that we had on the planet eventually was underneath the surface um
15:16
these plate tectonics tectonics and emails so what we are talking about here
15:21
is that everything that you see all the lands that you see today get recycled over
15:27
time there is this very famous paper by base here and johnson that calculated the times of recycling of all of the
15:34
land that we had in the planet and they discovered while there is some variability in among the places on
15:39
average almost all of the places on the planet where you could have had the majority of life get recycled every 300
15:45
million years so basically it's possible that there was an evidence on life on many of these
15:51
places but if it is older than 300 million years that evidence is already gone so
15:58
plate tectonics basically what it does it cannot remove the the biological evidence that it left
16:04
from a species and that is one of the explanations for why the historical record of life only goes back 500
16:09
million years or so most of it the other reason for why the historical
16:16
record is not so because it doesn't go back that far is because the individuals
16:21
are capable of leaving the evidence those ones that create a skeleton are actually not very old so
16:27
when you look at for instance the cambrian explosion that goes back only 500 million years those are the ones
16:32
that start leaving fossils behind and again those individuals are only came about in the history of evolution of the
16:39
planet 400 million years ago on that you had the diatoms that came out 200 million years or the forums so again the
16:45
species that are capable of living evidence came out relatively late in the history of the planet so it's very
16:51
likely that during the trip during the last during the three billion years of the history of the planet that
16:57
we don't know much about not many species might have been here to begin with and they probably just didn't have
17:03
enough evidence to leave behind so as i point out to you throughout the
Mass Extinctions
17:09
for that period of time for which we had a good record of life or the diversity of life on the
17:16
planet we had come to discover that there have been five mass extinction events as i described earlier a mass
17:22
extinction are those periods when over 70 percent of the species is going to stem so you can see here this is the the
17:27
percentage of extinction this is time and as i explained to you despite the fact that the planet the life of the
17:33
planet goes back 3.5 3.6 billion years the best record that we had is 500 million years you look at this record
17:40
you find these peaks on extinction and the reason for these picks of
17:45
extinctions are very diverse like the first one for instance uh the first mass extinction event they happened about
17:52
four four hundred and twenty million years ago and it's probably related to glaciations
17:57
that took a lot of the water from the oceans and as a result the oceans reduced the sea level
18:03
and many of the species that were used to live on the coastlines when extent there was just no no no no
18:09
stratus no habitat for them given the reductions in in sea level that's the second
18:15
largest mass extinction event was the first one to happen the second one and it came about about
18:21
308 million years ago and that is in the late devonian as possibly that it was related to volcanism
18:28
the third one is called the great dime this mass extinction event was brutal these things
18:35
wipe out most of the diversity of life on the planet especially in the oceans
18:41
the reason for why this make this extinction event was so massive is be believed to be related to volcanoes
18:47
somewhere in russia volcanoes start producing a lot of uh greenhouse gases that went and created this runaway
18:54
climate change when the planet heat up super fast the warming of the planet then caused
18:59
all of this methane that is on the deepest part of the oceans so what's happening there is that over millions of
19:05
years all of these sediment rich in organic matter that came from the land went and settled down on the sediments
19:11
on the ocean and it was converted by bacteria into methane it got frozen given the pressure and the
19:17
low temperatures and basically what we are talking about is this massive concentration of methane
19:23
that is frozen in time there now as the air starts warming up these deeper deeper parts of the ocean start warming
19:29
up as well and all of this methane that was frozen in ice it started getting melted and start releasing this methane
19:35
and that accelerated climate change and basically created a set of change of
19:41
reactions that almost wipe out life on this planet this is one of the most concerning
19:47
extinction events because today we see something similar with climate change we as
19:53
warming up the atmosphere with potentially which potentially could unleash all of these alternative sources
19:59
of greenhouse gases that are accumulating accumulated over time in different places on the planet
20:05
this event is called the great dime as i indicated to you over 96 percent of the species on the
20:12
oceans were when esteemed because of this guy here the forest mass extinction potentially
20:17
related to volcanoes as well and the last one that we almost likely know was the dome of the dinosaurs and we know
20:24
relatively very well right now that that extinction was triggered by a meteorite so
20:30
scientists looking for this meteorite came to find that this met terrorite hit somewhere in the gulf of mexico and
20:37
it has been very interesting you study the physics of these impacts it turns out that the significance of the impact was because
20:43
it hit the planet in a diagonal matter i don't really remember very well how that influences but it turns out
20:50
that the difference between this method and having such a huge effect was related mostly to the inclination in
20:56
which it hit the planet today people keep talking about this
21:02
huge extension of a species driven by humans and a question that has been posed are we now on a mass extinction
21:08
event okay as i explained to you mass extinction is when over 70
21:13
or more other species go stain so today we are not in a mass extinction event
21:18
however there are several papers pointing out that we are in our way there
21:23
so again when when you look at the species that had gone and stained in recent times only about one to two percent of
21:30
the species had gone and stained that we had a record for and we're gonna see later on that this is not really a
21:35
reliable indicator of how bad things are i'm gonna go to that in a moment however when you look at
21:41
what's happening to a species you see that many species are declining and that's the thing that is concerning and
21:47
again why we start foreseeing the presence of a mass extinction event on the horizon
21:54
given how fast many of these species are declining so the first
21:59
paper to document this idea of us being on the verge of a mass extinction event
22:05
was by this guy calvin barnoski and what he did here he took different groups of a
22:10
taxa and in here you can see the this black line represents what is defined as
22:15
a mass extinction event again when 70 or more of the species goes staying here in this specific case he used 75 percent as
22:22
a threshold and he indicates here the file then the fight that we know of one two three four and five
22:27
but then he sees what is happening today and what you see here are the species that are critically
22:32
endangered today those are the species that are the brick of extinction and as you can see if all of these species were
22:38
stained which is very likely given the fact that the arms are the brick they still don't reach that threshold of 75
22:44
percent the critical part though is when you analyze and the species are endangered or
22:51
vulnerable when you analyze species are in danger or vulnerable those are species that are today at the
22:57
start of this declining pathway so if you extrapolate the decline of these
23:02
species until the point that they question then it's very likely that you analyze all of those species by 2100
23:09
all of these species are currently in danger and vulnerable will accumulate to create a
23:14
way beyond what is a mass extinction event so again this is one of the pieces
23:20
of evidence that you can use to suggest that there is a mass extinction event on the way because again many species are declining
23:26
quite dramatically and you analyze the species that are today critically endangered endangered or vulnerable
23:32
eventually we are going to make it to that threshold off a mass extinction event
23:37
this is another paper that can be used to describe whether we are in a mass extinction event this paper was actually
23:43
a paper from my laboratory that we published in the journalist science in 2013 what we did on that paper was this
23:49
so here you take the number of species as a percentage so it could be five million eight million who knows doesn't
23:55
really matter for the purpose of this analysis and here we had time what we did on this paper was to mark what we
24:01
define as a mass extinction event right basically when over 75 percent of the species went stem
24:08
so what we did for this paper though was to compile
24:13
all the rays of extinctions from many different papers we took a bunch of papers that had reported extinction of
24:19
species and those rays of extinctions range from 0.72 percent per year to 0.22
24:26
per year and what we did then we took this number of species one percent and we start driving them extend by these
24:31
percentages and basically what we did is to calculate these scenarios of at this rate of extensions when are we going to
24:38
go to cross this stressful of what we call a mass extinction event and the number came to be sometime in the next century
24:46
so this is again another way to analyze the data that allows you to support the idea
24:51
that sometime in the next few decades we are going to be crossing a mass extinction event and what i want you to realize is
24:57
that in the past those mass extinction events had taken thousands of years to develop we are
25:02
talking about 100 200 years in which we actually push the life on the planet to to those
25:08
stressful that it has taken millions of years before just for you to realize the significance of what we're doing to our
25:13
planet today another thing that we did on this paper was to calculate the number of species
25:20
that are being described every year so today we only know about 20 of these species that live in the planet we are
25:26
describing on the ray of 8 000 species a year so what it means is that if we continue to describe species at a rate
25:32
of 8 000 per year you can see all of these species are still undescribed all of these species
25:38
that are going to stain we don't know the names for them so basically what we are
25:44
talking that we described on this paper is that many of these species are going to stain without us even knowing their
25:49
names without us even even giving them a name that's the ray of which where the
25:55
driving species to extinction today here are some examples used for you to
26:00
put faces to these numbers of the ray of extinction here we had the tasmanian tiger
26:06
this species was used to live in tasmania for four million years this is the area where it was restricted to
26:12
unfortunately humans go to that place and there was a conflict between then eating what we eat and in seriously 200
26:19
years we wipe out that species from the face of the planet this is the last thing you are left i
26:25
want you to look at that guy man this is the last guy of the tasmanian tiger he was kept in a zoo in tasmania there
26:33
and he he was kept in captivity and the animal died exactly on september 7 or
26:38
1936. a few years later six years earlier in 1930 the while the wild version of these
26:46
animals was hanging out somewhere in the field somebody took a gun and shoot the guy so imagine that we had the record of
26:53
exactly the last time that we killed the last individual that was in the wild 36 years later
27:00
this one guy died in the zoo and when these animals died the whole species
27:05
will sting what i want you to look is look at the desperation of that animal man can you imagine you being the last
27:10
individual left there is nobody that you can share the planet with you despite the fact that you had owned your right
27:16
to be on this planet like every other species and he was asked in just 200 years to wipe out that species
27:22
now what is super sad about this species is that the last individual as i
27:28
explained to you died in 1936 and in that year the government of
27:34
tasmania introduced law to protect the species can you imagine how
27:39
like this is like a joke you know the year in which the species goes sustained is when we all get
27:45
concerned to protect the species when it's already way too late so that species when it's
27:50
laws to protect that species were introduced the year when the last thing we will die
Western Black Rhino
27:57
so here is another species this is a western black rhino it was used to live in africa for 50 million years this is
28:03
the part where it was used to live there were time records in which the populations were estimated to be in the
28:08
order of a hundred thousand individuals for some reason for some kind of sick reason
28:15
at least with the tasmanian tiger it was basically we were the animal was eating what we eat but in this case we just
28:22
somehow got an appetite for the horns of this animal that's sick and basically what happened is that in
28:29
just 40 years since since we created a trade value for
28:34
the homes of this animal the species went extinct and unfortunately we had an actual
28:39
scientific record of the time when when the last time that we saw it was in 2006
28:46
and it was the clearest thing in the world in 2011.
Golden Toad
28:51
here is another guy that went to steam this is the golden toad though this animal was used to live in south america
28:58
for 60 million years can you imagine like being on a place for 65 million years until somebody come along and
29:04
destroy your habitat in this case the reason why this guy went to steam
29:10
was because of climate change it turns out that there were many
29:15
elevations high elevations where the frogs managed to survive from this fungi
29:22
that kills them and this fungi couldn't reach higher elevations because it was too cold but as climate change started
29:28
increasing the temperature of those higher elevations he expanded the geographical range of these fungi so
29:34
basically these stoves run out of space that they could escape the fungi and
29:39
eventually in just 30 years the species went again the last time that we saw this a golden
29:47
toad was in 1889 and finally we decided to declare the species of sting in 1982
Caribbean Monk Seal
29:55
this is another one this is the caribbean monk seal this is another one that is very interesting so when
30:00
christopher columbus got to the caribbean they estimated that the total population of this species was 250 000 individuals
30:08
there were tons of these in the world christopher columbus when he gets to the caribbean he grabs his own in his
30:13
logbook that there are so many of these animals that they covered completely the beaches and sometimes you have to push
30:19
his animals away can you imagine going from that level of density to a species going completely extinct
30:26
in this case the reasons why we kill this animal was to feed on their on their meat but also
30:31
to use their their their fat to to to so that we can see at night can you imagine
30:37
eventually the the entire species was driven to extinction in just 300 years
30:43
since the time that it came in upon contact with people to the time that we drove that species to extinction it was
30:49
300 years the last time that somebody saw that species was in 1952 and again another
30:56
sarcasm i believe here was that people decided to start protecting the law in 1967
31:02
and it was declared in 1967 and the species was declared in 2009 i want you to realize these numbers
31:08
though this one is even sadder because the species was probably already extinct when we decided to
31:14
to create laws to protect the species so that's the tail here of the monsieur
Species
31:21
but there are hundreds of those species this is species when it's in in 1981 here we had 1970 the caspian tiger 1970
31:30
here this guy 1989 this one here still in 2000 that one in 2003 ambassador this
31:38
one 2004 2008 2011 man i started getting the
31:43
goosebumps i have been giving this presentation for so many years and every time that i give this presentation i get
31:48
freaking good sponsors man just to realize the craziness of what we are doing to our planet this species in 2011
31:55
1941 1900s esteem in 1980 many of these species
32:01
that are going to stand even this one's called lucky that at least we took a photograph of them many species are going to stain and we don't even have a
32:06
photo nor a name for them 20 000 species could be easily going to stain every year because of what we do
32:13
to our planet now unfortunately
32:19
describing claiming extinction is very hard for a scientist saying that a
32:24
species is a sting is very hard the reason being that as the species start declining
32:32
the few individuals that are left become rare so it's possible in fact that with
32:37
the last time that we see individuals there might be some time after in which the individuals are against so rare we
32:42
don't see them and eventually it might take a while for the species to question from the time that we last in an example
32:47
is this guy here the johnson river dolphin it's a beautiful
32:53
mammal from the johnson river there's a pretty cool story about this guy and
33:00
in china but basically what happens was that the last time that we saw this dolphin was in 2002 yet in 2006
33:09
four years later somebody took a video recording of the river and something came out on the surface of the river
33:15
that seems to look like a dolphin because of that footage that doesn't necessarily confirm that the dolphin was
33:22
still there we failed to declare this species esteem and again even to this day there is
33:28
still controversy whether this animal is sustained or not and the reason why
33:33
a is controversial for a scientist to put an uh uh to put a date when the species
33:39
goes sustained is the fact that we might be wrong in the sense that again when the species decline they
33:45
became they become so rare that we don't see them so based on the fact that we
33:50
saw them last is not necessarily a good indication that the species is not there despite the fact that
33:55
it reflects a reality that the species might be at the brick of extinction
When do we declare a species rare
34:00
so as a result one of the key questions in biogeography is when do we declare a species esteem that is something that
34:06
we're constantly struggling with so that people can better appreciate the significance of what we are doing
34:12
let me just give you an example on a paper that tried to address this question was a paper by andrew solo and
34:18
one of his students looking at the dodo this species was used to live in mauritius island in the indian ocean
34:25
the last time that somebody saw this species was in 1662
34:30
okay but as i explained what happens when the species is declining is the fact that
34:36
they don't become rare so it becomes harder to find them so you might necessarily
34:41
the species might still be there despite the fact that you might not see it so what they did they took all of the
34:47
sightings of the species up to 1662 and they created a distribution of the time
34:52
that it might take for the species to go esteem and basically what they managed to to
34:57
calculate was that this species probably wasn't in 1690 so again the last time that we saw it
35:04
was in 62 possibly when it's seen 30 years later so what they claim on this paper which
35:10
is in the journal nature is that in this case example it took about 30 years from
35:15
the time that we last saw a species to the time that it went stain and that again poses a huge
35:22
concern for many of the species that today had become so rare that we had no seed and possibly already a steam but in
35:28
scientists we got away and according to this paper we gotta wait 30 years for us to be able to finally claim that the
35:33
species question at which time it's already too late as we demonstrated with those case examples
35:39
so that is one of the concerns of us trying to to to highlight the significance of
35:46
the environmental crisis based on extinction is the fact that extinction is very hard to document scientifically
Probability of Extinction
35:54
so rather than saying when a species question there are other metrics that
36:00
have been trying to highlight the significance of the all the status of some species one of that
36:06
is what is called the probability of extinction which is a paper by nick dolby and in this paper
36:12
basically they had a mathematical equation i don't really want us to go into the specifics of it but basically what you do is given the times when the
36:19
species has been recorded you can then calculate the probability that the species is
36:24
speciesist in this one example for instance of the of the surgeon here they estimated that
36:30
this species there is an 85 chance that the species is esteemed again you are interested in the equation it's pretty
36:36
straight forward to calculate here i don't want you to pay attention to it other than knowing that there is an alternative way that rather than us in a
36:43
species of sting we can rather say a probability that the species stings so when you say that it's a 95 percent
36:48
chance of that the species going to stay and that already kind of reveals the that that species is likely facing
Time of Extinction
36:56
another metric is what we what is called the time of extinction this is done by a colleague of mine christine where basically we
37:02
published this paper together back in 2010 and some other professors that were qualities on this paper what we did in
37:08
this paper what christina did was to look at the declines of species that we
37:13
see today and extrapolate that decline to then calculate eventually when does the density of this species reach zero
37:20
and from today to the time that the density reached zero then you can calculate that time and you can come up
37:25
with an index that is called the time to extinction again another metric that highlights the significance of the
37:31
crisis for many species now another interesting question about
Time of Recovery
37:38
geography when you look at the history of ortana is to identify how long it has taken the planet to recover from those
37:44
distinctions and there is a very interesting paper here by kerner and well in nature in 2002 so in this paper
37:49
they had two interesting plots one looking at the extension and as you see as we described earlier there
37:56
have been five mass extinction events one two three four and five but then the
38:02
other interesting plot of that paper is the ray of origination on new species obviously when a lot of species go
38:07
extinct and the conditions go back to normal there's a lot of space where species can originate and what they did
38:14
was to look at the patterns of origination and what they found was this very interesting pattern that for every
38:19
peak of extinction there is a peak of origination you can see the case here high extension high
38:25
origination high extension high origination high extension high origination so what that suggests is
38:32
that the planet heals of all these mass extinction events that have happened in the planet before the
38:37
planet has managed to heal and life comes back from this the interesting the
38:43
cash though is that it has taken 10 million years on average for the planet to recover from these mass extinction
38:49
events and that is another huge indication of how bad it is what we are doing to our planet today which is the
38:55
fact that it could take easily 10 million years for the planet to heal from what we are doing to it
39:02
i'm going to finish out this class by pointing out something that i find interesting about
39:09
what is to come once we start driving so many species a stent and there is this tail based on this tiny island easter
39:16
island in the middle of the lower pacific and what happens there is that 300
39:21
sometimes sometimes 300 to 1200 years
39:26
after jesus was born the polynations colonized that island right they got there
39:33
at the time that they get to this island yeah i can't you can imagine this right these guys get there in a in the canoes
39:38
get there and there is this beautiful island colonized with 20 21 species of
39:44
trees and multiple species of birds and they were the oceans there so
39:50
interestingly though for multiple reasons these people start
39:55
destroying their landscape okay no criticism there so if any of you is a pollination that
40:00
is from the place please don't take offense on this i'm just describing this example in which the people destroy
40:07
the biodiversity on those places again for multiple reasons one possibility is the fact that they use a lot of the
40:13
trees to build these huge structures that are left today it's possible maybe that they build this thing in a way to
40:20
pray to god to help them not to go esteem after they start seeing the end coming
40:25
but the matter of the fight was though that they cut down all of the trees and unfortunately they brought a lot of rats
40:31
with them and this combination of us cutting the trees and and us having
40:36
these pets that eat the seeds that were introduced by us as well led to basically a process in which the
40:43
populations that were there were being disappearing faster than they were able to replenish so imagine this thing we
40:49
were hitting this species these populations on both ends on one end we
40:54
were killing the adults cutting down the trees and on the other end we introduced these rats that were eating the seeds so
41:00
these trees and this biodiversity on this island just had no choice
41:06
as a result many of these species on that island were stained now what is
41:11
interesting is when you look at the number of people on that island the number of people got to be all the
41:17
way up to 10 000 people and then it just collapsed super fast right so what it happened
41:24
there you this is a very interesting documentary on this in national geographic when they ran out of
41:30
a species on land they could they didn't have a wood to build boats so all these fish
41:37
