
Introduction
0:05
right so today we're going to be looking
0:08
at the patterns in body size so let's
0:10
see how did we get here so we
0:12
established that a
0:14
five five 4.55
0:16
six billion years ago life came to be it
0:18
took about a hundred million years for
0:21
the moon to come out a billion years
0:24
in a standby which nothing was happening
0:26
other than maybe what is called the
0:28
protocol that is like a plastic bag that
0:30
contains molecules that then alive allow
0:33
the first forms of life to come out
0:35
about 3.5 3.6 billion years ago what is
0:37
called the prokaryotes that leads to the
0:40
eukaryotes and next thing you know you
0:41
had a
0:43
8.7 million species that we share the
0:45
planet with the species orientate they
0:48
disperse occupy what is called the
0:49
geographical range as the species
0:52
overlap their ranges they create
0:54
patterns in species richness and when
0:56
they start interacting with the local
0:58
environments and with other species then
1:00
they start changing their body size as
1:03
we established in the last class today
1:05
we're going to be looking at some of the
1:07
patterns in body size again how
1:09
the
1:10
the parents in the distribution of body
1:12
size in space and time let's let's just
1:14
get started again let's just review very
Review
1:16
quickly
1:18
how a species get to be the size that it
1:20
does we establish that is basically the
1:22
trade-off between the cost and the
1:23
benefit of the body size in the face of
1:26
several ecological and evolutionary in
1:30
forces
1:31
we established that some of those
1:33
factors eco ecological and evolutionary
1:36
factors that shape the body size of a
1:39
species are resources the ecological
1:41
interactions among species like
1:43
predation and competition climate and
1:45
human activities like hunting and
1:47
fishing as well
1:49
so obviously you can imagine there is a
1:51
huge variability on these driving forces
1:54
in a space and then there will be no
1:56
surprise that you are going to have a
1:58
huge diversity on the patterns in body
2:00
size which are the ones that are going
2:02
to be looking at today
2:04
so the first thing that you need to
2:06
understand given this huge diversity of
2:09
ecological forces affecting species
2:11
differently is that there is not going
2:12
to be a unique
2:14
way in which
2:16
biles influence the body size of a
2:18
species and here is an example for
2:21
instance of a paper by those guys there
2:23
and when they look in which they look at
2:25
the species richness of a
2:28
lizards and snakes which are both red
2:31
tails and you can see that they are very
2:32
similar in the pattern there is a high
2:34
diversity here and and a huge diversity
2:37
here and the diversity decreases as you
2:40
increase latitude so the pioneering
2:42
species relations is very similar but
2:43
when you look at their body sizes of
2:45
these two taxonomy groups you find that
2:47
they are actually very contrasting
2:49
patterns and again there's one evidence
2:51
that to suggest that right there that
2:53
there is not going to be a single
2:54
mechanism that can explain variations in
2:57
body size so most likely it's going to
2:59
be something that is
3:00
specific what makes these patterns on
3:03
body size
3:04
similar or different among species in
3:06
space
bermans rule
3:08
let's start looking at the patterns
3:09
though one of the first patterns that
3:12
you find about body size in space is
3:14
what is called the beckman's rule the
3:16
berman's rule suggests that the body
3:18
size increases
3:20
in colder temperatures the consequence
3:22
of this rule here that you have to be
3:25
big every time that is cold is that you
3:27
find normally species at higher
3:29
latitudes having bigger body size but
3:31
why
3:32
the explanation for this is basically
3:34
this what happens is that
3:37
when you look at the
3:39
the body size of a species against the
3:41
temperature of these places normally
3:43
what happens is you find that they climb
3:46
again in body size as you increase
3:49
temperature and the explanation for this
3:51
is basically the ratio between area and
3:54
mass so here's an example for instance
3:56
of an also a species that should be
3:58
large it has a mass of 8 basically
4:00
multiplication of this axis let's
4:02
imagine that this is the body size of a
4:04
unit species so you can see that the
4:06
area will be 24 the mass 8 so the area
4:08
to mass ratio will be 3.
4:10
in this case you will have a smaller
4:12
species a mass of one and ariel six and
4:14
you can see that in this case this
4:16
individual smaller this individual that
4:18
is smaller has a larger
4:20
area to mass ratio
4:23
let me just simplify this how how does
4:25
this have to do anything with
4:27
temperature though so the best example
4:28
that i can find that most people can
4:30
relate to imagine that you had a big
4:32
potato and you want to cook it so you
4:34
put the potato on on hot water you will
4:37
realize and you leave it there for a
4:38
while
4:39
and you take it out you could you find
4:41
that at times the core of the potato is
4:43
not cooked well right that's because
4:45
it's big
4:46
the area to mass ratio is a small so
4:49
basically there is a hard time for
4:51
energy to get to the core so if you cut
4:53
a potato in half what you do
4:55
automatically you have the same mass but
4:57
now you increase the area of exposure of
5:00
that potato as a result normally you
5:02
cook potatoes faster that are smaller
5:04
and again the consequence of that is
5:06
because there is more area exposed to
5:07
the elements that allows them to that
5:10
energy to get faster to the core of the
5:12
potato here is kind of the same thing
5:14
but in reverse in the sense that a
5:16
species
5:17
needs to maintain energy energy is
5:19
something that you don't want to be
5:21
wasting so if you are big what happens
5:23
is that the energy that is inside your
5:25
core is going to have a hard time
5:26
escaping to the environment so
5:28
places that are cold but you really need
5:30
to preserve energy the evolutionary
5:32
strategy is for you to get big so that
5:35
you can accumulate or maintain that heat
5:38
better so you were to have any species a
5:40
small a higher latitudes obviously on
5:43
those cases those energy species will be
5:45
selected against because they will be
5:47
losing energy heat so fast that there
5:49
will be not enough energy on the places
5:51
to sustain
5:53
such as mild bodies bodhisattva and
5:54
obviously resources being a small
5:56
maintenance situation even worse for a
5:58
species that are small
6:01
so again that's what is called bear
6:02
man's rule basically the general pattern
6:04
is that you find an increase in body
6:06
size with temperatures getting colder
6:08
and the likely explanation for that
6:10
pattern is the area to mass ratio
6:13
although related to the area that you
6:15
have exposed to the elements kind of
6:18
allow you in relationship to the mass
6:19
allows you to dissipate or maintain heat
6:23
better
Allens rule
6:26
now another pattern that you will find
6:29
in body size is what is called allen's
6:32
rule basically what happens in the
6:34
allen's room is that the limbs and
6:36
appendages get shorter or more compact
6:39
in individuals living in colder
6:40
temperatures right so you look at the
6:42
legs the ears actually other attributes
6:46
of the species normally what you see on
6:48
those appendages of a species is that
6:50
they try to shrink or become smaller at
6:52
higher latitudes the reason for that
6:55
again is exactly the same explanation
6:57
that we have for magnus rule that is
6:59
probably related to the need for you to
7:01
maintain energy so here is an example
7:04
for instance let's imagine that those
7:05
are two appendages they have the same
7:07
mass
7:08
right but here the area i compacted this
7:11
one more right so the area is larger
7:14
in this one i increase the area by
7:17
changing the position of the same cubes
7:19
so now the area is 28 and you can see
7:22
how there is a change in in
7:24
the area to mass ratio and obviously in
7:27
this case you want to be optimizing
7:30
making this smaller so that you have
7:32
less area as opposed to the elements so
7:34
that you can maintain and that could
7:35
explain why then
7:36
the the species try to reduce their
7:39
appendages and again it's just a way to
7:41
reduce the area that is exposed to the
7:43
elements as a way for them to maintain
7:45
energy one of the likely explanations
7:48
for allen's rule again this
7:50
attribute of most species having a
7:52
smaller appendages when it gets colder
7:58
oh i actually actually i should point
8:00
out as well that in
8:02
hot temperatures like for instance in a
8:06
in the tropics
8:08
you actually get the opposite effect
8:10
which is appendages becoming larger or
8:13
more in having larger area and again
8:16
because on those cases what you want to
8:17
do is to dissipate that heat in this
8:20
case as opposed to higher latitudes
8:21
where you want to preserve heat in
8:23
colder environments you actually want to
8:25
dissipate the heat as well
Kobs rule
8:28
another pattern that you will find in
8:30
bodhisatt is what is called code rule
8:32
and basically what it suggests is that
8:35
lineages these lineages that we're
8:37
talking about earlier of these
8:39
philogenetic branches of evolution what
8:41
happens on those lineages is that the
8:43
species tend to get bigger in body size
8:46
over those lineages over evolutionary
8:48
time so here is an example of all the
8:50
horse different
8:52
genuses of the horse and you can see
8:54
time and you can see how the earlier
8:56
genus of that species was smelling body
8:59
size but or as time
9:01
comes by those in species became larger
9:04
that's what is called kob's rule and
9:06
again is basically over evolutionary
9:08
time species tend to become larger
9:12
and there seems to be
9:14
different reasons for why that's the
9:16
case there is this paper by hon and bent
9:18
on entrance and ecology revolution in
9:20
2005 that so you guessed that obviously
9:23
you are big you're not going to get
9:24
eaten as easy but there are also
9:27
benefits to mating success and fecundity
9:30
in addition of course as to as what i
9:32
just mentioned about them having a
9:33
higher chance of survival there they
9:36
seem to be evolutionary benefits for a
9:38
species to get bigger over evolutionary
9:41
time
Island rule
9:43
another pattern that you will find in
9:46
body size is what is called the island
9:48
rule the ida rule is very interesting
9:50
and basically what suggests is that
9:52
species that get two islands being big
9:55
will become small and species that get
9:57
to islands being a small will become big
10:00
so here is an example for instance do
10:02
they have the name of what it is i guess
10:04
not but this is a a generalized example
10:07
of a species that
10:10
have been found on islands are also on
10:12
the continents and here what you see is
10:14
the ratio of the difference in body size
10:16
between the species on those islands and
10:18
the species on the continent and what
10:20
you find
10:21
again is that species that are large on
10:25
on the land become bigger on the island
10:29
the same species we are talking about
10:30
the same species or similar species on
10:33
the continent becoming larger on the
10:35
islands and species that are larger on
10:38
the continent becoming smaller on the
10:40
islands the reason for that
10:43
well the pattern itself again is that a
10:45
species that are large small
10:47
will become large
10:49
and species that are large will become
10:51
smaller all right because the reason for
10:54
that again is that maybe
10:56
here you had an ecological
10:58
release and
11:01
over here you have something that is
11:02
called resource limitation again when
11:05
you get to an island being big
11:07
you obviously have a demand for a lot of
11:08
energy you are not going to have that
11:10
energy
11:12
there so you are going to reduce your
11:13
body size just like in the case of the
11:15
mammoth that was found on granges island
11:18
right the species that got there were to
11:20
be too big resources were not sufficient
11:21
then the spot the species became smaller
11:24
in other cases when the species get to
11:26
islands being a small obviously there is
11:28
a lot of resources the species are going
11:30
to optimize their body size those
11:32
resources are valuable but then
11:33
increasing the body size they have they
11:35
have more benefits for the cost as a
11:37
result they will increase their voice
11:39
size and again
11:40
this is something that happens when you
11:41
get species that live on the continent
11:44
moving to islands and what you find
11:46
again is that there is a change in body
11:48
size depending on whether species were
11:49
large or small to begin with
Importance of body size
11:55
now
11:57
as we did with species richness there
11:59
was a when i finished that chapter i
12:01
explained to you why is it that it's
12:02
important for us to study
12:04
species richness we're going to be doing
12:06
the same thing here to understand why is
12:08
it for us important for us to understand
12:10
body size we already established
12:12
in this lecture that one of the
12:13
consequences of you becoming smaller is
12:15
that you produce also fewer offspring
12:17
with less capacity to survive so that a
12:19
lot is a negative consequence of the
12:21
species becoming smaller
12:23
however it has been found though that
12:26
normally what you find is that the
12:28
species that are there is a higher risk
12:30
of extinction on a species that are
12:32
large so anytime that we start killing
12:34
the animals that are large that seems to
12:36
accelerate the risk of extinction as you
12:38
can see here on this paper by ferrero
12:41
which is obviously not that good given
12:42
the fact that most of the evidence
12:44
suggests that humans like to kill the
12:45
bigger fish
12:47
the other thing that you can see again
12:50
is in the race of extinction and what
12:52
you find though is that most of the
12:55
species that are large seem to be the
12:57
ones that are a large race of extinction
12:59
and and you can see that in the
13:01
evolutionary record for instance this is
13:03
a paper by deerson in a science in 2024
13:06
in which they look at the body sizes of
13:07
species that have been driven to
13:08
extinction by humans and
13:11
our resident history and what you find
13:13
though is the fact that over time we
13:16
seem to be left with the species that
13:18
are smaller so here you can see the body
13:20
size and the number of species in
13:22
different time periods of time and you
13:25
can see how over time one of the
13:27
consequences of humans is that we are
13:29
being left with smaller with the subset
13:31
of species that have a smaller body size
13:36
now another interesting piece of aliens
13:39
who highlight the significance of
13:40
species changing their body size is that
13:42
it has been found that before the
13:44
species one of the consequences one of
13:46
the attributes that change a lot when a
13:48
speech is going a scene or one of those
13:50
signals or signs that the species are in
13:52
trouble
13:53
in the way to extinction is that they
13:55
start reducing their body size and this
13:57
is a paper in nature by this guy here
13:59
that shows for instance a species of
14:00
horse that went stain and one of the
14:02
things that you can observe on on these
14:04
species before it went esteem is that
14:06
their body size they climb so again a
14:09
very worrisome sign given the fact of
14:11
what we see with the frogs for instance
14:13
facing climate change and many other
14:14
species reducing their body size or fish
14:17
in reducing the body size of a species
Summary
14:21
let's summarize the entire class so we
14:23
found that body size is determined by
14:25
the resources the interactions
14:28
ecological interactions like predation
14:29
and competition climate and human
14:31
treatment evolution like hunting and
14:33
fishing and as for the patterns we found
14:36
burman's rule which is again the
14:37
increasing body size with latitude at
14:39
times also the increasing body size with
14:41
decreases in temperature the allen's
14:44
rule which is basically that the limbs
14:46
or other appendages of many species tend
14:48
to become smaller and more compacted
14:50
most likely as a result as a way to
14:52
protect the the heat that they had
14:55
there is also the cob's rule which is
14:57
basically body size increasing over
14:59
evolutionary time and the island rule
15:02
which is that species from the
15:04
continents that get to islands being big
15:06
will become small and species that get
15:09
to islands being a small will become
15:11
large and that kind of summarizes the
15:14
dissection about body size on the
15:16
patterns and processes thank you very
15:18
much and see you guys in the next
15:19
episode
