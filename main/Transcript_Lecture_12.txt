
0:04
all right we're approaching the end of the course today we're going to be looking at ecosystem functioning
0:10
and let's see how did we get here though so we established that a
0:15
4.6 billion years ago the planet came to be it took about a 0.1 billion 100 million years for the
0:23
moon to come in then for a billion years nothing is happening other than maybe the creation
0:29
of this thing called protocells that work as a plastic bag that allows to contain molecules that then allow for complex
0:37
things to emerge that led to the emerging the emergence emergence of prokaryotes that then led to eukaryotes
0:44
that a 3.0 something billion years after the first prokaryote
0:51
we ended up here with about 8.7 million species we established that once the
0:56
species originates which can happen in four different in four different pathways
1:01
i start the species start spreading until they colonize an area that is called the geographical range
1:08
many species doing this simultaneously leads to the overlap with your graphical ranges and
1:14
such that when you go and count the species on a given place you end up with different diversities on different
1:19
places and that leads to what is called the parents in species richness and we also show that once those species
1:27
start interacting on places and adapting to new environmental conditions you end up having different
1:34
body sizes and abundances now another thing that will emerge from you having
1:39
different species biomasses and abundances on local communities is basically they start
1:45
interacting and they start creating what is called an ecosystem and how that ecosystem works is the topic of a big
1:52
field of biogeographical ecosystem functioning so again basically what we're talking
1:59
about here is the the top three vials that we have described so far on how energy gets
2:05
allocated once get to the planet basically the number of species the body size of those species and the abundance
2:11
of those species and the interaction of all of these factors is what you get
2:16
what is called the ecosystem functioning so how is the consistent functioning of
2:22
an ecosystem nature though generally speaking functioning is defined as the efficiency with which
2:28
energy fluxes through an environment that's the definition of ecosystem functioning basically how efficient is
2:33
energy to flow through a given ecosystem so how can do you make how do you measure that in the real world when you
2:39
look at a given ecosystem you find a lot of different players species interacting
2:44
with each other and they are part of um different levels of the trophic pyramid you get
2:50
the energy and that energy gets taken by the plants then potentially decompose
2:56
and is taken by the primary producers secondary producers operators so you can start picturing
3:02
the different levels at which you can start measuring the how the energy flows
3:07
through that ecosystem at the most basic level of course you get the composition and you can start measuring things like
3:14
nutrient cycling how nutrients a model would get changed through a given ecosystem you can start looking then
3:20
potentially at the primary production how much energy from here goes through the nutrient cycling that ended up
3:27
allocated to primary producers you can also start looking at secondary production or you can look at the
3:33
biomass or the entire ecosystem so here again are some indicators that you can
3:38
use to measure how the energy flows through through a given ecosystem of course it's very complex the flow of
3:46
energy can go in so many different ways and the reason why scientists normally focus on just one or two of those bibles
3:53
there so as it relates to ecosystem functioning
3:59
of again the flow energy the efficiency of the flow of energy on a given ecosystem
4:04
most of the focus has been on how that efficiency relates to the number of species
4:10
let me just give you some background in mathematics just so that you can understand in a moment the relationship
4:15
between ecosystem functioning and biodiversity mathematically this equation here y is
4:21
equal to a times x to the power of b is what is called a power model it's a
4:26
power model because you have this coefficient that elevates the x value to the power of b
4:33
now it turns out that when you have that y variable here on this plot and the x
4:39
variable here on the x-axis what happens is that the number of these power exponent
4:47
determines the shape of the relation to the relationship between x and y so this
4:53
b parameter is smaller than b normally what you find is what is called a saturating curve right so as you can see
4:59
here it's a saturating chord as you increase x y also increase but then after certain
5:05
increases on x y doesn't increase that much so you get what is called a saturating curve
5:11
also it's called concave down relationship and it's again cases when the power model has a b exponent that is
5:18
smaller than one when that exponent is equal to one then of course
5:23
you forget about a then y will become equal to x and again
5:29
you get a linear relationship between x and y there are other cases though where b is
5:35
larger than one in those cases what you find again is normally relationship that are concave up or
5:42
exponential relationships in which a y increases exponentially for small increases on x
5:49
again that's what is called the power model and what i want you to keep in mind is the the significance of that b
5:54
parameter okay depending on the b parameter you can get concave down
6:00
linear relationships or concave up relationships that is important because in a moment we
6:05
are going to be looking at how people around the world have been trying to relate ecosystem functioning on the
6:11
y-axis against biodiversity and what is the parameter that they have found
6:16
so there is this guy brad cardinale he's the one that kind of started to put all of these papers together so obviously
6:23
having hundreds of papers related relate relating ecosystem functioning against richness and put it all together and he
6:29
found on this paper in 2006 that out of 111 papers that have been published at
6:35
the time the power parameter was between point one fifteen and point zero thirty two
6:42
basically what we are talking about here is that all of these experimental studies have shown what is called a
6:47
saturating curve or a concave down relationship exactly the shape that you see here so this is a consistent
6:53
functioning whatever method you choose here against the number of species richness what it was found is that as you
6:59
increase the number of species on an ecosystem the functioning of the ecosystem tends to flatten out
7:07
now that is the paper by cardinale again they put together 111 papers here and they found that in
7:14
experiments all of the relationships had shown that biodiversity the functioning of an ecosystem flattens as you increase the
7:20
number of species there is this other paper by mitchell loro and he found exactly the same thing
7:26
again this is a huge diversity of stories that he put together and he shows here that again in this case
7:31
productivity as a metric of ecosystem functioning flattens saturates as you increase the number of
7:38
species but the question then becomes why why would that be the case why will
7:45
these experiments show that the number of species as you increase the number of species that function on the amount of
7:51
energy that flows through that ecosystem tends to flatten out so in a paper written by micheloro again in
7:57
2001 he speculates that there might be two driving forces for this relationship
8:02
basically if you had a pool of a species and you increase the number of species one of the things that will could
8:08
potentially happen of course is that you are going to have more traits or more functions and that leads to what is
8:13
called complementarity we talked about that earlier when you talk about explanation specialization and basically
8:20
when you have many species combining together you are going to be using multiple parts of the resource and that obviously
8:26
will increase the number of the amount the amount of energy that can flow through an ecosystem the other
8:33
possibility that they speculate is that as you start increasing the number of species like in this case assuming that
8:38
the size of these triangles is related to the biomass that is flows through a given species one of the things that you
8:44
will observe obviously is that the arsenic species are more abundant they are bigger so they are going to have a higher chance of having a larger flow of
8:50
energy through them they speculate that when you start increasing the number of species there
8:55
is a chance that you might by chance alone picked out those species that have large in
9:01
capacity to produce biomass and again that's what it's called that's what they refer as a sampling effect something
9:08
after again is just you having a random chance of picking up a species that can
9:14
either hold or produce more violence and that is again to the to the driving explanations for why is it that all of
9:21
these experiments had shown a concave down or saturating relationship
9:27
between functioning and species richness
9:32
so when you look at the relationship again that seems to be universal from experimental studies is the fact that
9:39
the relationship saturates but one of the one observations that you can still make out of the hundreds of papers is
9:45
that there is a huge variation on the slopes of these relationships in some cases
9:51
biomass increases quite dramatically in other cases it doesn't increase as dramatically the question then becomes
9:57
why why is there such a variability here on the relationship that has been found
10:03
among studies between the functioning of ecosystems and the richness of those ecosystems so there
10:08
are multiple explanations again here we're trying to explain what does the case one hypothesis that was proposed early
10:15
on is the history of colonization it's a paper by fukuma and peter mourinho in
10:21
2003 this is what they did just for you to realize that science doesn't need to be
10:27
complicated so they have these jars right maybe a gallon block of jars and
10:32
inside those jars they have rotifers protozoans ciliates and microphone for
10:38
isolates and these are microorganisms that you can actually will will pop up
10:43
on any of these any things that you live in open and you can normally see that when you put water and let it outside you start
10:51
seeing turning green and those are kind of again um algae but then that algae allows for all
10:58
kind of microbes to arrive including these guys here so one of the things that they did though was to identify
11:04
these guys very well and what they did after was to modify the order in which
11:10
these guys arrive in the jar right so basically there is like a priority effect once the species gets to the jar
11:16
and then what happens when the second species arrives and basically what they did they modify the order in which these
11:22
species arrive and then they analyze here a consistent functioning they look
11:28
at productivity versus species richness kind of the reverse on the axis but you have to forgive them for that but the
11:34
point of their paper was that depending on who do you put first on those jars you end up having
11:40
different relationships so here they have the same relationship with the same species over they
11:47
modifying a b c and d is the order in which these guys got to those jars and
11:52
then that allows them to conclude that the history of colonization who gets to a place first
11:58
can potentially shape quite dramatically the shape or the relationship between functioning and biodiversity and you can
12:04
think about it right so imagine there is an empty island and a species that gets there first obviously has a higher
12:10
chance of colonizing potentially becoming more productive if that by any chance that a species is
12:16
a weak producer then the relationship that you are going to get is going to be completely different if
12:22
the species are arrived first is a species that produces a lot of energy or that that is sufficient as a recycling
12:28
energy so again one of the first explanations for why there is a viability in the
12:35
relationship between ecosystem functioning arrangements was produced by fukuma and maureen and suggests that is
12:41
simply the history of colonization or the order in which species arrive to ecosystems
12:48
another explanation for this variability is the telogenity of the habitat there is a paper that was produced that was
12:55
published by this guy tilianakis in plus biology i don't know if i don't know the person though but that's
13:01
his or her last name what they did they look at the grasslands i mean natural grasslands
13:07
it's just landscapes that look like this and they look at the relationship between bellow biomass they basically
13:14
took all of the biomass of those grasses and they related against the number of species and what they did though was to separate
13:20
locations that had higher heterogeneity medium heterogeneity and lower
13:26
heterogeneity and they find that depending on the level of habitat heterogeneity you get different shapes
13:33
of that relationship so whenever there is high soil heterogeneity you have you get a much steeper relationship
13:39
basically you produce a lot more biomass for the same given number of species when it's medium the slope is still
13:47
inclined it is positive but not as steep but when there is soil heterogeneity that is low that is almost
13:54
the relationship is very flat the question again just to summarize
14:00
here when you take the relationship between the functioning and the diversity one of the and you take for
14:05
instance one point of diversity what you find is that the diversity at any
14:11
heterogeneity increases as you increase heterogeneity again the biomass
14:18
production or the functioning that you get is significantly higher for the same level of diversity as you increase
14:25
heterogeneity well you can think about why why would be habitats that are more heterogeneous
14:31
have more biomass than habitats that are not acetogeneous given the same number of species the potential for that again
14:38
it could be simply a specialization to those habitats so basically species inhabitants are heterogeneous can
14:44
specialize and optimize the use of resources in certain places and that will potentially maximize the amount of
14:50
biomass that you produce on those places as opposed to places that have low heterogeneity when a species
14:57
obviously can interact more freely among them and that interaction of course reduces the the efficiency of a species
15:04
to to cycle energy because they will have to spend and waste a lot more energy on fighting each other competing
15:10
than in producing biomass again thinking about the reasons for why
15:15
there is a viability on the relationship between functioning and diversity one possibility as well is the habitat
15:24
heterogeneity another possibility that has been suggested is for this variability is disturbances this is a
15:32
paper by brad cardinale and palmer and what they did they analyzed these
15:37
cut cuties flies and they look like these these are animals that inches that you
15:42
see living on streams and here what they did they looked at again the biomass
15:49
production of habitats where that species was there there and the number of species on those places and they had
15:57
these hydras that they they stored and sometimes they did on the other side
16:02
the other group they did the surf and then they looked at the biomass of those places that were disturbed against the places that were not disturbed and they
16:08
found different relationships here so for instance in the places that were not disturbed which are these places in
16:14
black you see that the biomass increases as the number of species
16:21
increases while in places that are disturbed the biomass increases
16:26
as the number of species increases so post this video and think about why
16:31
why will there be the biomass of an ecosystem increase as you increase the level of disturbance given same number
16:39
of species as opposed to a place where there is no disturbance obviously
16:44
one potential explanation here is that when you get a disturbance basically the disturbance allows to to remove the
16:52
competitive advantage that some species might have so obviously you don't have disturbance they're especially going to
16:58
start interacting and there is going to be an imbalance that is going to make one species to be more dominant than the other one and that will cause
17:04
potentially an extinction of the species that is weak however when you have disturbances it's possible that these
17:10
species that start dominating start getting knocked out by the disturbance because it's more abundant and that kind
17:16
of allows them those two species to coexist and as a result become more efficient in the use of energy and that
17:22
is one potential explanation for how disturbances will cause
17:27
variations on the relationship between biomass production and the species richness
17:33
and again what we're just talking about here is the stain to which disturbances can help to explain that variation that
17:40
we find between the biomass that is produced as a function of the number of species
17:48
another possibility to explain this variation again between rich functioning and richness is ecological interactions
17:55
this is a kind of a review written by emma duffy in ecology letters
18:00
and it shows here that when you look at ecosystem functioning measure as different types of biomass against the
18:07
diversity you will find that there are different patterns to that relationship whether you look at the diversity of
18:14
plants alone where you put albiros alone or where you plants and herbivorous
18:19
alone so what he argues there is always there are different species with
18:25
different capacities to to cycle energy and this also
18:30
changes in the efficiency of energy from one ecologic trophic to the next one and
18:35
obviously that you can expect those variations cause different um
18:42
shapes on the relationship between biomass and diversity and again this is a paper by duffy and
18:49
it suggests that some of this variability that we find in the relationship between functioning and richness is a function of ecological
18:56
interactions another possibility for this variation
19:04
is basically an interaction between disturbances and trophic levels
19:09
right annie this is a paper by patchy i think this is the same guys that did the work
19:15
before that we talked about earlier and about the the priority of arrival this
19:20
is the the group by peter morin and again the same deal they had these jars
19:26
and what they did on these jars though they had different groups of species that can be classified as producers
19:32
bacterial right herbivorites and predators and what they did they start warming up the water they start warming
19:39
up the water on those containers and what they find is of course as expected is that when there is warming the
19:45
predators the herbivorous and the the ones that eat bacteria they normally
19:53
die more wherever it is hot right makes sense if you think about big predators and bigger
19:59
vibrators they are going to die when it gets hot while producers and bacteria-related species they don't die
20:06
as much so what you can expect just from this figure of them determining the rate of
20:11
extinction of a species on those aquariums and most of the species that die when you heat up the water being predators and
20:17
herbivorous and the ones that don't die as much are producers and bacteria that alone already tells you then that
20:23
in ecosystems that you get heat up are the producers and the bacteria that the ones
20:29
that are gonna produce the more biomass and in fact that's exactly what they did
20:34
so here they had the results of experiments that they hit up in which they had different types of diversity
20:42
and with different these four groups and they in some aquariums they hit them
20:48
and in all aquariums they just get them at room temperature what you can see here is that in aquariums where they
20:53
were swarming and especially in high biomass in high diversity there was a high
21:00
biomass and again in low diversity there was still a hot biomass and those are again the species that the biomass that
21:06
is produced by producers exactly this group of species here as you can see temperature didn't do much
21:12
to these guys but when you analyze the the biodiversity of that species in the
21:19
entire ecosystem on ajar and you start heating it up obviously there is no surprise that they actually are the ones
21:24
that produce the most biomass and ecosystems that get hot as opposed to ecosystems where the temperature remains
21:30
cold again the point that i'm making here is that anytime that you heat up the water
21:36
what they found is that most of the biomass that is produced on those aquariums are by the species that
21:41
survive they call the hotter temperatures which were their producers now however when they analyze the
21:47
biomass of the entire ecosystem all of the jars not just the ones that manage to survive the temperature what they
21:53
find though is that the the ecosystems that were the hot were
21:58
producing the least amount of biomass while the ones that remain constant
22:04
produce the more energy seen that interesting finding there so what what they find here is the fact that in
22:10
aquarius that we're heat up right obviously the herbivorous and
22:16
predators die the energy that is available can be processed only by producers that
22:21
dominate the production of ecosystems in environments that are hot but when you analyze the total biomass that is
22:27
produced in those places it turns out that the biomass is much smaller than the biomass that is produced when the
22:33
temperature is constant basically in the environments that are hot you just kill off all of the the top predators and the
22:40
arbitrals so the energy cannot flow as easily there so that's the reason why those ecosystems that get hot don't
22:46
produce as much energy as opposed to the ecosystems where the temperature remain constant there again that's just not to
22:53
say that biomass producers didn't produce biomass because on those ecosystems all of the biomass
22:59
in the biosystems are hot all of the vitamins is produced by these producers at the end die because of the heat
23:05
one thing though that you two have noted to this point in this lecture is the fact that all of the studies that were done
23:12
early on for decades this is a field of research that started maybe in the 2000s and it has been going on for 20 years
23:18
now most of that work has been done at the level of experiments either in jars like
23:23
these or feel a few experiments that are relatively small so the the effect of this of course is that
23:30
the outputs are very simplistic you can imagine here we're trying to simulate entire ecosystems in the world based on
23:35
what happens on a jar obviously they provide interesting insights like we just understand here but can they really
23:41
be replicated their results at the global scale can they be translated to see really what's
23:47
happening in the real world to answer that question or really what's now happening in the real world this guy
23:54
came about his name is roberto da novaro he's from italy he pulls his paper on
23:59
deep nematodes he went around the world all of these places that you see here
24:05
in colors in these maps and he analyzed the biomass and the diversity of these
24:11
nematodes and what he find there which was even fascinating was that the slopes
24:16
or the relationships between ecosystem functioning and richness were concave up you guys remember all of the papers add
24:23
to that paper after this paper in 2008 were based on experiments and all of them have been showing concave down
24:29
relationships roberto de novaro for the first time goes to the field and wants to find out how is that relationship in
24:35
nature and he finds that the relationship is actually concave up
24:41
at the time when this thing this paper was in 2008 i got super intrigued on this and the reason why not many people
24:47
have done this globally online is because obviously you need to analyze the consistency over huge geographical skills that that it makes it for those
24:54
analysis to be super rare because collecting the data is super hard however at the time i i decided that i
25:02
wanted to answer the same question but i wanted to focus on coral reefs it took me about three years to put this
25:08
database together so what i did i i contacted a scientist from every one of those places i contacted easily 60
25:15
scientists that had collected data on the biomass and the diversity of fishes on coral reefs everywhere on those
25:21
places from the caribbean the eastern pacific the pacific ocean and the indian ocean
25:27
and i wanted to explore for coral reefs what is the relationship between biomass
25:32
and raciness am i supporting the world that was known by donald barrow showing that the relationship is concave up or
25:38
am i supporting the relationship by loro and all of these other guys cardinality showing that the
25:44
relationship is concave down so you can imagine my excitement as i was collecting this data from all of these
25:49
places around the world i put the data together on a plot just to see how the relationship looks like and this is what
25:54
i found that the relationship is actually concave up regardless of the region where you look at and that's the
26:01
the shape of the relationship that we found so now it turns out that we had a contrast
26:07
right so we had all of these experiments that have been done over hundreds of experiments by now showing that the
26:13
relationship between biomass and richness is concave down but then there are at least two studies done globally
26:20
showing that the relationship is actually concave up and the question then becomes why does the case
26:27
why in experiments the relationship is concave down why nature that relationship is concave
26:33
up one one impossibility we had another paper that i published with michelle laurel
26:40
and roberto d'anoaro as well was to explain why does why is that different one
26:46
possibility that we speculate is initial specialization so imagine that here you had two species
26:53
right in red and in blue those are two species when you had an experiment and you put experiment there right imagine
26:59
like an aquarium you put two animals that you take from a pond and put them into that aquarium obviously those
27:04
species are going to start interacting with each other there's going to be intense competition on that acquiring the resources are no limited there is no
27:10
places to hide the time that they require to to specialize in some of the orders of tons of years so
27:17
in experiments there is going to be a high degree of ecological interactions between the species that are put in
27:23
there while in nature the goals of past competition has forced these species to
27:28
already specialize so there is not going to be competition so the speculation here is that obviously in nature given
27:36
this higher specialization you are going to have higher production while in experiments that ecological
27:42
interaction between species is going to make species waste energy on that competition making them the production
27:49
smaller on experiments and again this is one explanation that we suggest for why is
27:56
it that in nature the relationship is concave basically through a specialization every species that is
28:01
added add more biomass while in experiments the competition that makes all species
28:08
to start competing for certain amount of resources that are there and that competition eventually just
28:14
forces a species to to minimize the amount of energy that is producing the
28:19
given ecosystem another possibility proposed by michelle
28:25
ro on this paper was that when you look at atrophic pyramids obviously you have the primary producers and the top
28:31
predators at the top there is there are flows of energy on this and one possibility that will be happening in
28:38
nature is that we are losing the top predators as we explained before and basically you lose that operators what
28:45
happens there is that then you increase the biomass the efficiency of lower
28:50
trophic groups and then that results in an increasing production
28:56
in nature that is simply the result of a tropic release of you clean off the top
29:01
predators right so basically by you're wiping out the operators in nature what you ended up with is most of the biomass
29:09
in the in an increasing biomass by the by the top by the producers that then
29:15
could explain why in nature you get this exponential relationship again basically what means what emitter suggests is that
29:22
by you losing that operator you increase the efficiency of production of primary producers in nature that explains why
29:29
that relationship is accelerating in nature but what are the implications of what's
29:35
the big deal so experiments find that this is saturating in nature is exponential well it turns out that there
29:40
are a lot of different implications for why this is seeing a significant issue for us to resolve what is happening in
29:46
nature the implications are this so when you lose a a species basically what you do you lose
29:54
exponentially the capacity to produce biomass or the efficiency in which you produce biomass on that ecosystem well
30:02
in experiments if we trust the evidence that comes from experiments we can really afford a lot of species being
30:08
lost without having too much change in functioning right so again that's the significance of this thing we're talking
30:14
about ecosystem functioning which are the things that we feed on from nature so this is what is happening in reality
30:20
which is an exponential increase every time that we are killing a species from nature we are tampering significantly
30:27
exponentially the capacity of that ecosystem to produce resources and biomass and functioning
30:33
but if what is happening is this then you can afford to lose a lot of different species there without
30:39
impacting the capacity of this ecosystem to produce biomass basically another thing from experiments
30:46
is basically the idea that there is a lot of redundancy on the ecosystem basically you can afford to lose any
30:52
species from here on because there are species that are redundant on those places in nature is
30:57
actually is actually quite the opposite almost every species is unique and that actually for me makes the most sense
31:04
because again through evolution and ecological interactions those species will be specialized into specific
31:11
habitats as a way to minimize that competition so in nature there is less redundancy meaning that again if you
31:17
lose that one species you might have lose an entire function of an ecosystem
31:24
so again just to summarize in nature almost the loss of every species could
31:29
have irreplaceable effects on the ecosystems while in nature you can afford to lose
31:35
tons of species and that will not potentially influence as much the functioning of the ecosystems and that again are some examples of the huge
31:43
implications of as needed to resolve what is really happening in nature here whether whether
31:48
it is concave up or concave down
31:55
so unfortunately that relationship between functioning and special reasons in
32:01
nature that understanding is very limited as i explained the the data that is needed
32:07
for you to analyze that relationship is very hard to collect and you have to collect it globally and that kind of
32:12
restricts the number of stories that are have tested this however with the data that we already had you
32:19
can get some insights into some of the variations that you find in nature so this is the paper
32:25
another paper that i analyzed in the caribbean this is the data just for the caribbean and you can see here the
32:30
biomass production of coral reefs in the caribbean against the number of species and again as i explained to you is
32:37
concave up in the prior paper analyze every single region in the world in this one paper it
32:42
was only the caribbean though one of the things that we decided to do for this paper is that
32:48
one of the observations that we had was this huge variability though despite the fact that in average
32:53
the relationship is concave up you still get a huge variability one of the things that we decided to do was to separate
32:58
locations depending on how many people were on those coral reefs near those coral reefs so here is a relationship just a subset
33:05
of these points in which there was almost no people near the coral reefs and you can see that their relationship
33:10
is super exponential and super steep now when you start having locations
33:18
that have between a hundred people and a thousand people that relationship start flattening when you have people that is between a
33:24
thousand and ten thousand people the relationship flattens even more so i want you to start picturing from the
33:30
subset of ribs the relationship between biomass and richness start flattening
33:36
as you increase the number of people but what is remarkable though is the
33:42
fact that when you have a lot of people on coral reefs the the biomass that relationship increased the slope of that
33:48
correlation increase so think about this like the susception so the relationship that you will expect to see in nature
33:54
everywhere is this where there are no humans the relationship is super steep but as you start increasing the number
33:59
of people that relationship start flattening but when you had a lot of people that relationship comes back up
34:07
and and here you can see actually how steep it becomes when you have more than this is a million people near ribs these
34:13
are the slopes of these relationships here so i decided to linearize this and here you can see the slopes in these
34:20
columns depending on how many people are near ribs and this is exactly what i explained the relationship is super
34:26
steep where there is no people start declining as you increase the number of people but then it goes back up as you
34:33
increase the number of people so it seems like again when there is no
34:38
people functioning the capacity of ecosystems to produce biomass is huge as you start
34:44
putting people that if their efficiencies start declining but once you get to a lot of people that
34:49
efficiency for some reason goes back up so we decided to investigate why
34:55
right why would that ecosystem functioning changes as a function of how many people are near ribs
35:02
we think about two possibilities one is that as you increase the number of people you increase
35:07
you reduce the number of people that require that uses those resources or includes yeah right or the other one is
35:14
that somehow as you increase the number of people the pressures are so massive that ecosystems start adapting to that
35:22
to those pressures that are being put in there again two possibilities one is that as you increase the number of people you
35:28
reduce the the use of resources that you take from coral reefs you think about
35:33
this right so you had a million people that live on a place the reality is that not a million people
35:40
can be fed from a coral reef so you will expect then that at those levels of people
35:45
the impulse that we had on coral reefs will reduce as opposed to places where there is a relatively fewer people where
35:51
they can be fed over those coral reefs so the pressure could be more intense that's one of the speculations here
35:57
the other one is that maybe what is happening is that ecosystems start rebounding after something happens to
36:03
the ecosystems let's analyze the work that we did to test these two hypotheses
36:10
the first one hypothesis is that humans reduce their use of reef resources so in
36:15
this paper we analyze the data on the amount of fish that is taken from quarter roots per square kilometer this
36:21
is by country and this is number of people fishing right and we correlated that against the number of people what
36:27
you can see is that that relationship is steep on both cases so basically what we
36:32
are talking about here is that no this is a completely untrue that as you increase the number of people the pressures that we put on coral reefs get
36:39
smaller it's actually quite the opposite when you increase the number of people
36:44
you increase the amount of fish that is taking from the reefs actually there is a ton more people going fishing
36:50
and the same thing here when you increase the number of people to increase the number of people within that group that can go and fish as well
36:56
so this hypothesis was a kind of nullified because we found
37:03
evidence to suggest that no as you increase the number of people the pressures on coral reefs do not decline
37:12
the other possibility that we speculate here is that maybe what is happening is that there are changes in the in the
37:17
community of coral reefs as a way again to adapt to those pressures that we are putting here
37:24
so here you can see the diversity of the biomass this is sorry this is the
37:29
density of top predators and their body size in places that had no humans places
37:35
that had a lot of humans in red so what you can see here is that when you look at the top predators the density remains
37:43
almost zero across body sizes basically what you are
37:48
seeing what we are showing here on this red line is that in places that you had a lot of humans we take always they're
37:55
the bigger fish right in places where there are no humans you can see that ecosystems normally had a
38:01
higher proportion of big fish makes sense right you think about the northern hawaiian islands there is no people
38:07
there so you get to see a lot of big fish when you go and look at places like oahu where there is a lot of fish there
38:13
is no big story where there is a lot of people there is not a lot of big fish there so it seems that in nature even
38:20
under natural conditions of no human impact you don't get to have a smaller
38:26
top predators right so normally those in places anywhere you don't get to see
38:32
too many small predators but in places that had a
38:37
no humans toprators get to be very big very abundant while places that
38:43
you had a lot of people the predators that is large get to be pretty rare
38:49
now what happened what happens to their vibros fish the ones that get fed on by the top predators what you see actually
38:55
is that in places that had a lot of humans the density of small herbivorous
39:02
increases quite a lot so what we speculate here is the fact that
39:08
this shape on that relationship between functioning and richness declining as
39:15
you increase the number of people but bouncing back is simply an ecosystem release from you having top
39:21
predators in places where no human the relationship being super stiff humans start depleting their resources
39:28
and as a result of that depletion you start losing top predators you start increasing the density of a smaller
39:33
vibrators and then is that increasing the density of smaller arbitrals that causes the increase in biomass
39:40
their but one of the things that i want you to look at is the access of these columns you can see on places that had
39:46
no humans how you can produce up to 1200 kilograms of biomass i don't remember
39:52
sorry i don't remember what the units on this thing but you can see that the units are the same on all axes here is 1200 in places where there are no humans
40:00
in places where you have humans despite the fact that the relationship is trying to come back up the scale only goes up
40:06
to 900 right
40:11
so again what we speculate on this paper is that humans seem to induce some kind
40:17
of trophic changes in ref communities which in turn change changes the way in which energy flows through that
40:23
ecosystem is very similar to the word that was shown earlier by peter mourin when you start killing fish killing in
40:30
certain groups of species winning ecosystems by warming right when you kill the top predators and their vibrators most of the biomass is
40:37
produced by the producers but the biomass is still insignificant to compare to compared to the biomass that
40:42
is produced by entire ecosystem we are explaining the same thing here ecosystems
40:48
could produce a lot of biomass when there is no humans when you start having human impacts on those ecosystems those
40:54
consistencies are changing the the composition of a species so that at the very end you ended up with a huge
41:00
density of a smaller everywhere so obviously the amount of biomass that is produced by these species doesn't
41:06
compare at all to the biomass that is produced on ribs that have no humans
41:13
so why the whole thing is important though why is it important for us to understand this ecosystem ecosystem functioning well one of the things that
41:18
i want you to realize is that at the end of the day biodiversity
41:23
abundance and body size they come together into this thing called ecosystem functioning and that ecosystem functioning is what fits humanity at the
41:30
end of the day the the turnover efficiency in which the energy and resources flow through those ecosystems
41:36
is what we feed on right and as we establish today with this massive transformation of ecosystems we are
41:42
losing goods and services that sustain humanity so we are talking about here is
41:47
that with us impairing the capacity of ecosystems to function well we're inferring the capacity of those
41:53
ecosystems again to deliver goods and services that influence human welfare and in this class i already point out to
41:58
you some serious statistics in the order of a billion people going angry around a billion people lacking good water and
42:04
things like that there's also the economic value that we established before
42:10
this paper that we talked earlier by constanza that calculated the total goods and services from nature in the
42:16
order of 33 trillion dollars relies obviously or assumes that all of these ecosystems are effective at producing
42:24
biomass we're not only affecting again welfare as i explained earlier but also
42:29
the economic return that we get from nature let me summarize the class
42:35
again one of the key questions in biogeography is this relationship between the functioning of
42:41
ecosystems and the richness it has been found it's almost universal that in
42:46
experiments that relationship is saturating the reason why well one possibility is
42:52
those two paper that paper by laurel saying that it could be complementarity where species just complement each other
42:58
and that increases the number by the functioning as you increase radiation or the other one is what is called a sampling effect basically by chance
43:04
alone you might get certain species that are effective at producing biomass
43:10
what factors influence that relationship basically we found that among all of those experimental studies there is a
43:15
variability on the slope of that relationship some of the factors that can influence that relationship are the history of
43:22
colonization a lot of papers by mitchell by peter morin the heterogeneity that one paper in in close biology
43:29
disturbances this is the word by brad cardinale and ecological interactions
43:34
and peter mourin also had the last paper talking about ecological interactions and disturbances playing together to
43:41
influence this the shape of this relationship we also discover how describe how in
43:47
nature this this same relationship between functioning and richness is actually concave up
43:52
and we speculate that the factors that will influence that relationship are human population
43:58
the reason why this relationship is important for us to understand is because at the core of it is the
44:03
production of goods and services that we obtain from nature and that is going to influence human welfare and that
44:09
finishes the class for today and see you guys in the next episode
