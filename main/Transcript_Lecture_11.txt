Intro
0:03
all right so today we're going to be looking at abundance let's review very quickly how did we get here we
0:09
established that there were about 4.6 billion years ago when the planet came
0:14
to be 100 million years later the moon was formed a billion years passed by and nothing is
0:20
happening in this planet other than maybe what is called a protocell which is just like a plastic bag that allows
0:26
to contain molecules that allows complex processes to emerge that led to what is
0:32
called the prokaryotes which are organisms that don't have a nucleus
0:38
mostly bacteria and archaea and then from those we move to more complex
0:44
forms like the eukaryotes and moving forward to today which are the planet with 8.7 8.9
0:52
million species we established as well that in the process of origination or new species which can happen in four
0:58
different in four potential ways and the species occupy
1:04
certain areas and those areas are called geographical ranges many species doing
1:09
that simultaneously it leads to what is called parents and species richness
1:14
once the species get to those places interact with other species and their environment they start changing
1:20
attributes of the species and we in the last class so how that could influence body size and today we're going to be
1:27
looking at how those interactions among species with their environment can also
1:32
can also influence uh abundance
1:37
so let's start by first thinking about what are the factors at the most basic level
1:43
that will influence the size of a population keep in mind that a population is a group of individuals of
1:49
the same species so what are the factors that determine why certain species have the abundances
1:55
that they do you think about whales why they are so fewer wells than they are individuals of ants so at the most basic
2:02
level the size of a population can be reduced to two factors the input and the
2:07
output and it's the balance between the inputs and the outputs that determine at the end how many individual units are
2:13
having in the population the demographic factors that influence the input are natality and immigration
2:20
basically in the input is what is adding individuals to a population the most basic level is how many negatives are
2:27
being born and how many individuals come from somewhere else what is called immigration now on the output you have two
2:34
demographic factors one is mortality and the other one is immigration right mortality is how many individuals die
2:41
and that obviously is taking us out of the population and immigration is basically taking individuals out by they
2:48
do those moving somewhere else is the balance between those four demographic factors
2:53
natality and immigration and mortality and immigration that make power that determine at the most basic
3:00
level the size of a given population so mathematically that can be defined in
Density Independent Growth
3:07
numerous ways and the earliest attempts to quantify the size of the population
3:13
is what is called density independent growth as the term implies is basically a growth of a population that is
3:20
independent of how many individuals are there to begin with that's what is called a
3:25
so here let me explain the mathematical equations so again you look at the the
3:31
factors that i outlined before so you have natality plus immigration again these are inputs and that's the reason
3:37
why they are added minus mortality minus immigration and they are negative because they are
3:43
subtracting and is the balance between those four factors what is called the population growth rate mathematically at
3:50
times as indicated as a fraction or as a percentage so
3:55
here you you get a sense of the growth rate against again as a proportion or as a
4:00
fraction you can easily cut then calculate the size of the population using this equation it's pretty simple
4:06
basically what you have here is the population size mathematically that's commonly defined with the capital error
4:11
n at a time t plus one okay so that t plus one normally indicates a generation or
4:19
year who knows depending on the study that that you had at hand you the way to read that is the size of
4:25
the population at a time at time t plus one is equal to the size of the population at the current time plus the
4:32
size of the population at the current time times the growth rate right so let's say quickly for instance
4:39
that the growth rate is ten percent and the size of the population is ten so that means that the
4:45
population t plus one is going to be a hundred which is the population size right now
4:51
plus a hundred times point one or ten percent that's ten that means that the size of the population at
4:58
a time t plus one is going to be 110 for a population that is growing at a ten percent
5:04
automatically the growth rate is exemplified here on these equations and again it's the same
5:11
exercise that i just did before here i had a different populations three populations one two and three growing at
5:18
a rate of ten percent twenty percent and thirty percent and at different time skills right and basically all what i do
5:24
is for every tiny step i recalculate the population at a given time based on the
5:31
growth rate and then i obtain these plots here so here you can see for instance the size of the population over
5:37
time when the growth rate is 10 20 and 30 percent as you can see from these trends these
5:44
trends increase exponentially and they are called what is called density
5:50
independent growth because here you see the size of the population the size of the population here there is no controls
5:56
to it the size of the population is growing as a simple function of the growth rate there is nothing controlling the population
6:03
really in nature however that's unrealistic there are things that control the size of the populations in
6:08
nature and many times they are actually dependent on how many individuals are there and that then led to what is called
Density Dependent Growth
6:14
density dependent growth in which now the size of the population is going to be controlled based on how many u.s are
6:21
there in the population that is also called logistic model or low cambodia model load campultera are two
6:27
mathematicians that independently came up with the same mathematical model to predict the size of the populations
6:34
so what they did which is pretty simple but still pretty clever was to use exactly the same mathematical equation
6:41
that we just used which is density independent again the population size being a function of the current
6:47
population times the growth rate but they added something to that what is called a carrying capacity and the
6:53
current capacity is identifying with the letter k and the way to model that mathematically is one minus
7:00
the size of the population at the current time divided by k so let's just make a quick example for you
7:06
to realize that this is actually not that complicated so here you have the size of the
7:11
population at the current time the following thing that we have to do is to find out how much individual how many use more are going to be added to the
7:17
next for the next time basically what it is is the current number of individuals time the growth rate
7:23
times one so let's imagine that the current capacity is a hundred right and
7:28
the current size of the population is a hundred so a hundred here divided by a hundred that gives you one one minus one
7:36
gives you zero basically as a result all of this term becomes zero so the size of the population at a time t plus one is
7:42
going to be equal to exactly the scoring size the size is not going to grow because the current capacity is already
7:48
at the top of i'm sorry because the current size of the population is already at
7:54
current capacity this term here
7:59
mathematically is what is called density dependence ratio and again is a term a whole mathematical equation that was
8:05
introduced by those two guys back in the day now here you can see
8:10
a population like the ones that i just simulated before growing at a rate of 0.3 30 percent per generation but here
8:17
what i did i simulated these populations here having different carrying capacities so in this case i had
8:23
carrying capacity of 50 and you can see how the population stabilizes at 50. here i have carrying capacity of 100 and
8:29
the population stabilizes at 100 150 and the population stabilizes at 150. so
8:35
this effect of the current capacity again all what it does is to control the size of the
8:41
population as the population start reaching the carrying capacity
8:47
here just for you to realize the contrast on the grow rate that is density independent at
8:53
30 percent so in right here this is what you will expect of the population growing at a rate of
8:59
30 percent per generation but what will happen here when you have different carrying capacities impose
9:05
upon the population basically just it narrows down having you guys are added to the given population
9:12
now the next thing that you have to then figure out is what is the control what is controlling the current capacity of a
9:19
population right what factors do control how many viewers can be hold on a given
9:26
place so one potential factor is competition and competition can also be modeled
9:31
mathematically basically what you do here is to recalculate this mathematical
9:36
equation by basically accounting for the abundance of the other species that you are competing with
9:46
another thing about competition and population size that i should mention right away is what is called the
9:51
principle of competitive exclusion so it was a an idea introduced back in the day
9:57
by this guy called harding which is the idea that when species compete and one species gains and a competitive
10:04
advantage over the other as small as it can be over time it could become significant to the point that one
10:10
species that one that dominates is going to drive the other species to extinction that's what is called the principle of
10:16
competitive exclusion and it was proof here with these parameters and you can see how the populations of these two
10:23
species when they are separated in separated cultures they stabilize at the current capacity of wherever they are
10:29
being grown but when they are put together one species the one that you can see here in red getting becoming more
10:36
abundant than the one in blue you can see that the one in rue in red when they are combined becomes dominant and it
10:42
drives the species in blue to extinction that's what is called the principle of competitive
10:48
exclusion and the idea behind this is that a species that compete for the same resource once a given species gains an
10:55
advantage is going to drive the other species to extinction this has been challenged quite a lot
11:00
in nature well it works very well in experiments in nature this hasn't been proven the reason being that in nature
11:07
there are many heterogeneities inhabitant and climate that allows
11:12
species to specialize to resources such that they can both live in the same place
11:17
while a well is still a man managing to survive
11:23
and again that's what it's called initial specialization and what it is is a species um adapting to different
11:30
uses or resources such that they reduce the the area in which they overlap in competition with other species
Predation
11:38
we'll explain that also before another factor that control the size of the population is predation obviously
11:45
you are getting eaten by by a predator your numbers are going to increase quite dramatically for that you are the prey
11:51
if you are the predator obviously the prey reduces then you you're not going to have enough energy to produce offspring so the predator might also
11:59
decline as well the prey depending on the oscillations of the prey has been found on mathematically it can
12:05
be can be modeled as well i don't want to get us into too much detail about the mathematics on this but what i want you
12:10
to realize or to know from this class though is that there is commonly uh
12:16
oscillation patterns that are alternative between the population size of the prey and the population size of
12:22
the predator so they tend to oxidate quite a lot so
12:27
when so when the predator for instance increases in abundance the prey is going to decline there is going to be a point
12:33
where the prey declines so much that there is not enough food to sustain all of the predators so the predators are going to decline when the predators
12:40
declined and their prey had a release and they are going to increase their abundances and that creates again this oxilation that is alternative between
12:47
the abundances of the predators and the prey now
12:53
those are what are density dependent controls the ones that we just look at like competition and
Density Independent
13:00
predation however there are other controls on the population that are independent of the density basically
13:06
what we are talking about here is factors that influence how many individuals you get in a population regardless of how many individuals are
13:11
there and those are normally factors like for instance environmental tolerances you can imagine for instance
13:18
temperature right temperature doesn't really kill care if you have fewer or fewer few or a lot of individuals on a
13:25
given place that reason why it's called density independent factor because it has an effect on the population that is
13:31
independent of how many individuals are there here is an example for the for instance
13:37
the the effect on on temperature on the population there is always always going to be optimum conditions where you get
13:44
the highest density of individuals when it gets too hot the density declines and when it gets too cold the density
13:49
declines as well and here is an example of a variable that is density independent again it's going to
13:55
influence the size of the population independent of how many individuals are there
Meta Population
14:02
now another set of factors that influence the size of the population is the the dispersal capacity of the species and
14:09
the quality and availability of habitats let me just explain to you so early on we talked
14:16
about there being factors like immigration natality immigration and mortality that
14:22
influenced the size of the population two factors are important here are immigration and immigration right what
14:30
that means then is that the populations are going to be interconnected by what is called dispersal so and that led to
14:38
what is called a meta population meta population is patches of populations that are
14:44
connected by dispersal so it's the same population that we were talking about earlier but now we are assuming that
14:50
there are many similar populations everywhere and all of those populations are connected by dispersal in that case
14:55
you are going to be referring to what is called a meta population and again our example of patches that are
15:01
interconnected by this person in that case there are several factors
15:07
that become important to maintain a meta population
15:12
one of them is the isolation of those patches obviously if the patches are too far apart there are going to be fewer
15:18
individuals capable of moving from one patch to another one and you can imagine how that's going to influence the population size on those patches
15:26
the other one is going to be the patch size obviously larger patches have a capacity to hold more individuals that
15:32
is patches that are small the way their attribute is the quality of the patch so obviously you have
15:38
patches good with good environmental conditions you are potentially going to have more individual patches in which the conditions are unsuitable
15:47
so those are three key attributes as they relate to the habitat that are
15:52
important for a meta population this is an example here of this guy hill on a
15:57
paper that he did on journal of american animal ecology in butterflies
16:04
so now with that being said it turns out that there are several rules
16:10
about how habitat influences the size of a population the first rule
16:16
is that the larger the patch the larger the population the larger the patch the larger the rate
16:22
of immigration so i want you to think about this rule here again if the patch is larger there is a higher chance of
16:28
you migrating and the best example that i have for this is this back in the day maybe 25 years ago i was invited to
16:35
austral to hawaii when i was an undergrad in colombia and i came over here and when you know when we were
16:41
going back after i realized that it was a very long flight in that flight the capital two hours into this plane into
16:47
this flight the capitan say we had a navigation problem and we had to go back to hawaii i am not
16:55
joking i grabbed myself from that chair i was about to scream and i was just waiting for somebody else to scream for
17:00
me to start screaming as well because that idea just terrified me what terrified me even more was the idea that
17:05
the capital decided to turn himself back my reasoning was that why are you gonna
17:11
if the navigation system is grown why are you gonna turn back trying to find hawaii which is a tiny island in the
17:17
middle of the pacific when you can just keep going straight and eventually if the navigation system
17:23
is completely grown eventually you are going to be able to hit the continent giving the fact that is a much larger
17:28
space so it's kind of the same reasoning here ecologically if you had an area
17:34
that is particularly large you had a much higher chance of individuals that are moving around even if they are
17:39
moving randomly to get to that place if the patch is small then you have much smaller chance of anything getting there
17:46
so this is a very important rule as it relates to the impact of habitat on meta
17:52
populations which is that the size of the patch determines the rate of immigration or immigration to that place
18:00
now obviously this one is another rule that kind of makes sense the smaller the
18:05
isolation the larger the input of new individuals so obviously you have patches that are closer to each other
18:10
there is a higher chance that individuals might cross if the patches are too far apart then you have fewer individuals going from one patch to the
18:17
other one and this one is another rule that will make a lot of sense that suggests that if the
18:23
patch has a good quality of resources there then you might have a more
18:29
abundant populations or more resilient populations on those places there is evidence for these rules
18:35
everywhere so here is just some examples that i point out to you of different papers that kind of support these
18:41
different rules and again they are generally well established rules as they relate to
18:46
the characteristics of the habitat influencing the size of metal populations
Summary
18:53
let's summarize the class up to now we already established that the size of the population is regulated
19:00
by the input and output of individuals in the input we had immigration and natality in the output we had
19:06
immigration and mortality we also established that this immigration and immigration leads to
19:12
what is called meta populations we also established that these factors that influence the size of the
19:19
population locally could be related to ecological interactions like predation competition mutualism etc and and as it
19:26
relates to the size of the meta population there are also important things like the size of the patch the
19:31
insulation of the patch and the quality of the patch and we established as well that there
19:36
are several environmental constraints mostly density
19:42
independent bio that also play a role into the size of the population so
Abundance Patterns
19:48
that summarizes what are some of the drivers some of the factors that influence the
19:53
abundances of a species now let's look at some of the patterns that have been
19:58
observed in in abundance across the species so
20:04
the first pattern that has been observed in nature is what is called the
20:09
frequency is the abundance frequency distribution so these plots here normally they are referred as frequency
20:16
distributions and all what it is is basically a frequency of a species as a function of a given attribute so here
20:22
you can have body mass range size or abundance if it is abundance it's
20:28
going to call abundance frequency distributions if it is range size it's going to be called the range size
20:34
frequency distributions if it is body size it's going to be called body size frequency distributions and again all
20:40
what it is is just a plot that that describes the frequency of a species
20:46
here on the y-axis as a function of different attributes that are measured there on the y on the x-axis
20:53
so going back again to one of the main patterns on abundance is what is called the species abundance frequency
20:59
distribution and what it shows is that in most communities if you were to go any community in the world in the world
21:05
and example all the species that are there the abundances what you find is that most of the species are rare well
21:11
very few species are very abundant right so again
21:16
the general pattern here on the species abundance frequency distribution
21:22
keep in mind that you can play around with those terms moving back and forth as far as they contain the same words they mean the same
21:27
and the idea here is that in most communities most species are rare and
21:33
that causes again for you to have a lot of species here in this case there are
21:38
more than 110 species with only one individual on this community in the river thames in which they sample
21:44
species of beetles the question is why that's another interesting pattern
Niche Partitioning
21:50
that's the pattern now let's look at the process why is it that most species are rare so there are several hypotheses
21:55
that have been proposed for this one is what is called niche partitioning it was introduced by robert mccarter back in
22:01
the day this is a very famous guy in ecology the idea of roma carter is this so imagine that you have a resource that
22:08
is outlined here in this blue line and once you get a two species
22:13
using that resource and we explain as a result of a niche a specialization those
22:19
two species are gonna specialize in the use of certain resources so they passion partition the use of the resource there
22:25
the idea of this partitioning now when a second species where three species arrive
22:30
it has to interact with one of the species so it's gonna partition the habit the resource with one of the other
22:36
species that was already established there anytime that a new species arrives it's going to start partitioning the
22:41
resources with species that are already adapted to that resource and that leads to what is called the needs partitioning
22:48
idea and as you can see from this example here you have species that
22:53
that are few of them have used can the capacity will use a lot of resources and
22:58
that's going to make them feel them with the capacity to use and resources they
23:03
are going to be very abundant but they are going to be very few while a species that use fewer resources
23:09
are going to become more and more abundant and that explains why that you get on a given community most species being
23:15
rare is because they gotta once they get to that place they have to compete with species already specialized there and
23:21
basically there is no more resource no much resources for them to be using and as a result those species become rare
23:27
and rare and rare and again the general idea the nice partitioning introduced by macarthur is
23:33
basically that there is a subsequential supervision of resources that cause progressively smaller populations
Neutral Theory
23:42
there is another idea to explain why that distribution is skew and it's called neutral theory mutual theory has
23:49
basically two assumptions to it one is that local communities are saturated with individuals
23:55
basically what it means here is that if you go anywhere in the world and you look at a place
24:00
the the habitat that you see there is completely saturated with individuals there is no space that is not being used
24:05
and they're the idea that they are saturated with individuals so that's the assumption number one of the neutral
24:11
theory the second assumption of the neutral theory is that most species disperse
24:19
very short distances well there are very few species capable of dispersing long distances basically what you end up
24:24
having is what is called a kernel distribution basically what it means here is that this is the frequency of
24:30
individuals and this is the distance for most species most species will disperse
24:35
very close to home and sorry talking about individuals here most individuals were dispersed
24:42
close will stay close to home while few individuals will manage to move farther away
24:47
this is what is called a kernel distribution and they are normally skewed to the left the idea here again is that if you look
24:54
at a given species most of the individuals will stay close to home very few of them will move
25:00
farther apart based on these two assumptions there was a guy several guys
25:07
one of them called bill that explained the the distribution of abundance is being skewed based on this
25:13
simple notion you think about this let's break it down into how can this neutral theory then explain why most
25:20
species are rare the idea here is that if you by any chance
25:25
lose an individual from a given place let's say that he died when he just died who
25:32
is most likely to occupy the habitat right now if you look at this frequency
25:38
distribution here what happens then is that the species that are more abundant locally
25:44
are going to produce a lot more offspring that are going to stay closer to home so basically what it suggests is that those species are already common
25:51
on a given place are the ones that are most likely to occupy species habitats that become empty the
25:57
consequence of this is that species that are common become even more common right
26:03
and the species that are rare will become even more rare and that is a an explanation that has been suggested to
26:10
explain the the frequency distribution of abundances uh
26:15
being left sq basically showing that most of the individuals on a given population are rare
Abundance Range Size
26:27
another pattern in abundance is basically the relationship between abundance and range size what it has
26:33
been found though is that species that have large geographical ranges normally have larger local densities as well
26:40
so here is an example this is a paper that was published by kevin gaston here you have multiple species and you can
26:46
see the geographical range size of this species whatever he was starting here against their density and what you can
26:52
see is that generally speaking there is a direct relationship here basically species that have larger graphical
26:58
ranges normally have also larger densities there are multiple explanations that
27:04
kevin gasson has proposed to explain this the first one is basically the idea that
27:10
species that are a abundant obviously had to use more space and
27:16
they use alone or that larger space will force the species to be present in a larger geographical range
27:23
the second explanation is that obviously if a species is locally abundant it means that it has a broader niche it has
27:30
a capacity to use resources over broader ranges and those same attributes then allows the same species to be found in
27:36
many other places given that the same resources might be just as diverse in other places
27:43
there is also neutral explanations for this relationship and basically what the
27:49
idea here is that locally abundant species had higher probability to disperse far away
27:54
from occupied places and then increase the range size again the idea is if you are locally abundant
28:01
and you're gonna have a lot of producing a lot of offsprings by chance alone that
28:06
is gonna lead to a few individuals reaching farther away places and that then causes for you to have a larger
28:12
graphical range when you have large abundances and the second explanation related to
28:19
neutral theory is that a highly dispersing species can maintain high local abundances over large geographical
28:25
areas again you are dispersing a lot and obviously that means that you're going
28:30
to have local abundances that are large because of that migration is enhanced but at the same time it will lead you to
28:37
potentially having a larger geographical range another relationship that should be
Abundance Body Size
28:44
obvious by right now is the relationship between abundance and body size
28:49
basically what it has been found is that species that have large body size are less abundant that are species with a
28:55
smaller body size if you think about this is like pretty obvious i think for you thinking about whales wells are
29:01
pretty rare right because they are huge and they are not that many individuals in comparison to things like ants
29:08
right they are small and they are super abundant but here is a a pattern though the
29:13
actual pattern between abundance and body size and this is a paper that was published back in the day by damon in
29:18
1981 and he shows here the relationship between body size and abundance of tens of species and you can see what i just
29:25
described to you in general in nature species that have large body sizes will
29:31
have smaller abundances species that have smaller smaller body sizes tend to commonly have
29:37
larger abundances this led to what is called an energy energetic equivalence rule it's a
29:44
concept introduced by a guy called brown and the idea here is that there is just
29:51
so much energy that comes from the sun that gotta be converted into biomass and a species had a choice between
29:59
that trading off this energy between either a larger body size or a smaller
30:04
and larger body size or smaller abundances right so again this
30:12
this this strain of this relationship between body size and abundance seems to
30:17
be the result of an energetic equivalence rule basically suggesting that the amount
30:22
that the amount of energy that comes from the sun is allocated by species by
30:27
either to either having larger abundances and smaller body sizes or choosing to
30:33
have larger body sizes but smaller abundances and that's what is called an energy equivalence rule you cannot have
30:40
both ways right you just bypass this slide here
Importance of Abundance
30:49
so as every single class that we have studied so far we have always finished
30:54
up those lectures by asking why are those attributes important so let's ask the same question here why is abundance
31:01
studying abundance important so the importance here of course is that abundance is related to extinction risk
31:09
obviously it makes sense that extinction by itself is the definition of abundance getting to zero but there are multiple
31:14
case examples that have been demonstrating that in historical and current times the decline in abundances
31:21
is a good indicator of the species increasing the risk of going extinct extent this is for instance a paper
31:29
published by pain back in 2011 and here what he did he looked at the
31:34
historical record and analyzed the stain in which the species that went extinct
31:41
whether they were rare or abundant and he created this ratio here i don't really want to get into the specific on this but basically you are above zero
31:48
that means that the rare species had a greater risk of extinction you are below zero that means that the rare species
31:56
had a lower risk of going a stain when you go through the paletological record what you find is that over time
32:03
regardless of the time period that he analyzed there most of the species that went a sting were species that were rare
32:10
he put the frequency distribution on here and you can see that generally speaking if there is any
32:17
evidence in the past to indicate that the risk of a species going to stain
32:22
it suggests that most of the species that had gone stain our species that have been
32:28
rare in the past and that obviously poses a major concern today
32:34
when we look at what is happening to the species in the planet this is for instance a report done by by the wwf
32:41
back in the day and they analyze the abundances of all the species in the world for which there is a good time
32:48
record and they analyze i believe over 3 000 populations that were monitored between 1970 and 2000 and what they
32:54
found is that of all of these populations for which there is data there is an average decline of 40
32:59
percent here are the actual trends again from 1970 to 2000 and you can see how
33:05
terrestrial species are declining marine species are declining water species are declining when you
33:11
analyze all of the species together they are declining so there is this general trend of an
33:16
incredible number of species declining which is kind of concerning even while pain just show that the species that
33:23
goes in more commonly are species that are rare so here what we are doing is making species more rare and
33:30
over time let's summarize the class when you look at the population size how
Class Summary
33:35
many equals are there on a given population you know that the size of that population is regulated by the
33:41
inputs that is natality or recruitment immigration which is how many individuals get to that population
33:47
on the output we have mortality and immigration we know that things related to natality
33:53
and mortality could be ecological factors that we talk about like competition and predation and density
33:59
independent factors like environmental tolerances like temperature habitat quality
34:04
etc factors that regulate immigration and immigration we talk about things
34:10
like the size isolation and the quality of those habitats as for the parents in abundance we talk
34:17
about the abundance frequency distribution basically most species in the planet at
34:23
any given community are rare we established that there are different ways to explain these patterns
34:28
related to the niche theory or the neutral theory in each theory being what macarthur proposed neutral theory
34:34
suggesting this this idea by bill graham bell that the populations
34:40
this that this species being rare can be explained by simple fact that all of the habitats are
34:47
saturated and the most of the species disperse close distances the other pattern that you will find as
34:54
it relates to abundance is that the larger the abundance the broader the geographical distribution we also
35:00
explain how niche and neutral theory could explain this and finally the larger the abundance the larger the body
35:06
size and we explained that this could be related again to how species allocate the use of resources energy that comes
35:12
from the sun and how they spread out that according to the energy equivalence rule that summarizes the
35:18
class for today see you guys in the next episode
