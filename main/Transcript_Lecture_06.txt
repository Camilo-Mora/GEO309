Introduction
0:04
hello today we're going to be looking at the species geographical range
0:10
you were to look at a book for the definition of a geographical range is basically the spatial area which
0:15
populations of populations of organic species are found let me just describe that in a different way as i explained
0:23
earlier once a species originates one of the first things that it does is to disperse
0:28
trying to colonize areas beyond the original place up to a point where it can have colonized most of the areas
0:34
where it can survive mostly is add to those points when it faces conditions that prevent the species of moving
0:39
forward so once the species colonize most of the areas where it can be that area is what is called or what is
0:46
defined as the geographical range of the species
Definition of geographical range
0:51
but what do we mean by geographical range let's look at an example here this is the white shark and a scientist had
0:56
documented a white shark here on all of these points that you see in red scientists then take the outermost
1:04
locations and create a polygon around them and then that's what ended up becoming the geographical range again
1:10
the areas where the species can be found as you can potentially appreciate though there are some limitations to the use of
1:16
the geographical range in the case of the white chart for instance you can see that there are many places in the oceans where the sharks
1:24
are never there but in the according to the geographical range the way that we calculate the geographical range the
1:29
species are there so it creates this kind of situation that a scientist addressed by introducing two alternative
1:36
definitions for the geographical range one definition is what is called the extent of occurrence the state of
1:42
occurrence is actually the subset of areas where the species are found so in the center of occurrence what they do is
1:48
they outline for instance all of the locations here in the atlantic along the americas and in the atlantic in africa
1:55
and basically they accumulate all those areas and then that becomes the the area the extent of occurrence
2:01
against subsets of areas within the geographical range where the species found and the other
2:07
definition that they introduce is what is called the area of occupancy which is the area within the outermost limits of
2:13
that distribution basically that polygon that i show in there the outermost limits of where the species are found
2:20
and what is the area that is within that polygon that's what is called the area of occupancy
Why is geographical range important
2:26
this is that though by looking at why is the geographical range of a species an important attribute to a study the first
2:32
one is that it allows to quantify the extinction rays of a species right it's commonly understood that a species that
2:38
had a smaller geographical range as we described in another class those species are endemic they're at higher risk
2:44
because imagine that the species only found in hawaii and there is a hurricane that passes by hawaii the entire species
2:49
was seen as opposed to imagine a species that are found everywhere a cosmopolitan species if there is a hurricane
2:55
somewhere in the middle does not want to attract the species to extinction so it has been found that
3:00
there is a huge risk associated with the size of the geographical range most commonly with the species that are at
3:06
the highest smaller ranges being a higher risk and obviously then with the geographical
3:11
range we can figure out what could be the consequences of human impacts on biodiversity this is a paper by walter
3:18
jets in which he analyzed here the changes are projected by 2100 according to
3:23
language change and clan and climate change he put it together then you overlap that with the geographical
3:29
distribution of a species and then it allows you to identify again the extent to which different species are going to
3:35
be are going to have the geographical ranges restricted in size right so again
3:42
this is a case in which the geographical range becomes an important tool for you to identify the potential risks that we
3:47
are putting species under as a result of climate change the other thing is that it also allows
3:53
you to identify areas of vulnerability so if you imagine that managed to collect the geographical ranges of all the species in the world you start
3:59
looking at where are most of the species with the smallest ranges which we know are species that are average of extinction then you can potentially
4:05
prioritize in the protection of those places given the higher rates that they are so this is an example here by
4:10
granger in which they analyze the distribution of birds and you can see here places where
4:17
most of the species are found most where most of the species are found in those places are geographical ranges that are
4:23
small so again they allow you to identify or potentially prioritize places where species with smaller ranges
4:29
are found when it comes to the biogeographical range of the species
Two important research questions
4:34
in in by geography there are two important interesting research questions there are
4:39
obviously tens of them but two of them have kind of driven most of the attention of biogeographical research one of them
4:46
is why species had a range that it does why the species is the given size why aren't certain species are found only on
4:52
some places while osps are found everywhere and the second interesting question is when you combine all the
4:57
species the geographical ranges of all of these species one of the things that you find is that most of the species in
5:02
the world had smaller ranges and very few species had large geographical ranges so just think about that right so
5:09
you look at tiny fish in the oceans it turns out that most tiny fish in the oceans had only smaller ranges but if
5:15
you look at whales there are very few species of whales that are found everywhere well most of these fish there
5:20
are tons of those species found everywhere in the world but most of them are endemic to the place so that's kind of an interesting question by itself why
5:26
is it that when you look at nature overall most of the species are there normally had geographical ranges that
5:32
are small so here's an example for instance on a paper by ormond using pericles
Why is the range that size
5:39
let's start with the first question of why the species had the range that it does when you look at a geographical
5:45
range why is that range that size one of the first ideas that was proposed is this
5:51
idea of niche the idea of nature is as follow basically what happens is there is when you look at two environmental
5:57
gradients like air temperature or the availability of food there is going to be a place in the interaction between
6:03
those two areas where the species is going to be found or where it's going to have suitable conditions like for instance in this case let's imagine that
6:10
here is super cold for the species here is super hot there is not enough food here is a lot of food but it's too cold
6:15
there's going to be this sweet spot where the environmental conditions are excellent for the species to survive the
6:21
combination of this suitable condition is what is called the niche right so an extrapolation of that idea to the
6:28
geographical range suggests that the species are found when the environmental conditions are suitable for the species
6:33
to be found and again here here is an example looking at just temperature basically
6:40
again there is going to be a place where the species performs optimally and
6:46
as the temperature increases or decreases the performance of the species is going to decline and um there's multiple case examples
6:52
documenting that that's the case again here is a paper by bennett and huge that took that a fish and they expose it to
6:59
temperature and they find that there is this very optimum temperature like for instance above 12 degrees
7:05
celsius which is fish survive well um anything that is lower than 12 the species
7:11
doesn't survive well so that the fact that the species can only live up to 12 degrees allows the species then to
7:17
survive in places that have more than 12 degrees temperature
7:23
unfortunately this idea of the climate being the driving force obviously makes a lot of sense right the fact that you
7:28
can only live when the environmental conditions are good and that could potentially explain why the species had the range that it does unfortunately
7:34
when a scientist went and investigated that they don't it found that actually they found actually very little support
7:39
for that idea so here's an example of a species that i started back when i was an undergrad many years ago called
7:45
talasomalu and this is where the species is found this is color in blue and yellow and
7:51
green however when you look at the geograph at the environmental conditions of these
7:57
places where it is found one of the things that you find is what it is what is called the suitable area so basically
8:03
all of these environmental conditions here along the east pacific where the species found today are also found in
8:09
many other places in the world but when you look at the species where it's found the species only found here in the
8:14
instant pacific so that alone is an indication that there is something more to where the species are found than just
8:20
the environmental conditions because in this case example the same conditions here in the eastern pacific where the
8:26
species found are found everywhere else but the species is not found on those places so there is something else
8:32
that determines how far the species can go interestingly though even within our
8:39
region at times environmental battles are not sufficient to explain
8:45
where they are found this is a paper that i did many years ago when i was an undergrad again with thalassoma lucasano
8:51
and i what i did i took this fish i went and collected from the field i put them in these aquariums and i started cooling down the temperature until i found the
8:57
temperature at which the fish don't survive well the magic number was 16
9:02
degrees celsius but one of the things that you look along the continental coast of the united states is that along the
9:08
americas is that that species only from from here to here that's where the species found today but when you look at
9:14
16 degrees of temperature it turns out that 16 degrees of temperature is right there and 16 degrees of temperatures is
9:20
back there and the species only found on this area so basically what we have here is this huge area north this huge area
9:27
south where the temperatures are suitable for the fish to survive but the species is not there and again is
9:33
another indication that while the environment indeed can lead can determine the boundaries of the
9:38
geographical distribution there is something else that determines where the species are found
9:46
now another idea that has been proposed as in regards to the niche is there the potential role of ecological factors on
9:52
that niche so basically what happens here imagine that you had two species one species in red the other one is in
9:58
blue this is the resource and basically you have most of the individuals using the resource here
10:04
at this condition and here at these levels and when you have two species then
10:09
using the same resource it turns out that there's going to be an area where they are going to overlap and
10:15
in the area of overlapping you also want a species have to compete with individuals of the other species and they have to waste energy fighting
10:22
what's going to happen over time is that in that area the individuals are going to go extend because basically there are
10:27
other places where they can do much better without that competition so over time this eye of competition that i
10:34
indicate here in orange when one species interact with the other species in the use of that resource
10:40
that competition will reduce the thinness of the individuals there as a result the species will specialize
10:47
right to use certain areas of the risk of the resource and avoiding that competition there that's kind of the
10:52
theory on this so as a result it has been suggested that this could be extrapolated to the geographical range
10:57
to then explain that by ecological reasons then could potentially exclude a species
11:03
from some places and then determine whether species are present on those locations or not unfortunately when this analysis was
11:10
done it was found that that might not be totally the case this is a famous paper by a big guy called macarthur robert
11:17
mccarthy he is one of the godfathers so to speak in ecology and he came out
11:23
with this idea that indeed this competition can indeed happen but rather than the
11:28
species going extinct what they do is to optimize the use of the resources
11:33
specializing on different places so what you ended up with is a species sharing the same places here as an example he
11:40
studied these birds and what he found in the case of the birds the they all used the same tree but now what they have
11:46
done is to specialize at different heights of the tree using different resources as a result they can coexist
11:52
in the same tree so while ecological interactions can indeed drive the local
11:58
distribution of a species it's very unlikely that these ecological interactions will determine the geographical distribution of species
12:04
again because in this case species managed to coexist
12:13
now another possibility for why the geographical range of a species is the way or the size of the shape that it is
12:19
is evolution let me analyze another case example here with the same fish that we showed talked before the thalassoma
12:25
lucas and from the eastern pacific so if you look at the geomorphology of the pacific and atlantic ocean it turns
12:32
out that back in the day 10 million years ago it was connected there was a big bridge between the two of them and
12:37
then because of plate tectonics and the the isms of panama started going up and eventually it separated the pacific from
12:44
the atlantic and that happened about 3 million years ago so 3 million years ago the pacific was separated
12:51
from the atlantic thanks to the eastmans of panama now you build the phylogeny of thalassoma lucas is playing one of the
12:58
prior classes basically looking at the relationship between talasomal casano and many other species one of the things
13:03
that you will discover so this is the phylogeny it was known by a guy como bernardi i think that he's at
13:08
the university of california he built the actual phylogeny of this guy and here he related that to the philosophy
13:15
of many other species and here is talasumalu one of the interesting discoveries of this philogenic is that when you look at
13:21
when talasomalu casanov was separated from their ancestral ancestors that was
13:26
three million years ago exactly the time when the isms of panama separated the pacific from the atlantic so one
13:33
possibility here for why the the the grass
13:39
is not in the caribbean is because by the time that it was born in that in the pacific there was the panama already
13:45
there the panama the panama is most of panama so he couldn't move to the caribbean so in this case evolution and
13:52
geomorphological changes over time are potentially a good way to explain why sony species are not found where they
13:57
are found as here in the case of the thalassoma it might it's possible that
14:02
it might not be found in the caribbean because by the time that it was born the pacific was already separated from the
14:08
atlantic and unfortunately for the guy he was born in the atlanta in the pacific
Transport
14:16
so another explanation that has been proposed to explain why species are where they
14:22
are is transport this is a paper here by these two guys here gaylor and gaines i think that games is at the university of
14:29
california i might be wrong about that but here they had this very clever paper where they found that maybe the
14:35
distribution of species can be constrained by changes in the direction of currents so basically what happens
14:41
for instance if you look at us an example here at the cause of the pacific coast of the americas moving from the north towards the
14:48
tropics is the california current because of the way that the the planet moves this current shifts
14:54
towards the central pacific in about the gulf of california and there is a similar current happening
15:00
at north what is called the peruvian current the peruvian current move along the coast of south america and it turns
15:06
towards the central pacific at about peru right and that again is determined by the way that the planet
15:12
moves so what they argue then is that for many species these storms on the changes in the
15:19
direction of the currents become boundaries for the distribution of a species when you look at something like that lucasarum for instance this
15:26
actually is a super good explanation for why that species is not found in higher latitudes despite the fact that the
15:31
temperatures are suitable it's simply the fact that it cannot migrate so you remember the
15:38
species born but then he had to move in this case if he was born in the tropics he got he wants to move a higher
15:44
latitude unfortunately the currents here are pushing the species down towards the tropics so in this case the opposite
15:50
currents prevent the species of moving south or north so this is a very clever
15:55
paper by by gaylor and gaines that's what is again the distribution of many spaces in many
16:01
species in the world especially in the oceans are restricted by changes in the erection of these currents
16:07
however currents alone are not the whole story because then if that's true that currents determine where the species are
16:14
then how is it that this species is not found in the central pacific when you have that current moving exactly in that
16:20
direction so basically these corners will take all of these species from the eastern pacific into the central pacific
16:26
but those species from here are not found there so transport again helps to some degree
16:32
explain sort of the boundaries of the range but not all of them another explanation that has been
Dispersion
16:38
proposed a lot to explain the geographical range of species is dispersal the idea being that different
16:45
species had different capacities to disperse so depending on the capacity of a species some can move reach farther
16:52
places than others let me just give you those some background information on how the species disperse especially in the
16:58
oceans and the great majority of species in the oceans when we look at sustrata
17:03
in the oceans it turns out that most of the distribution of those habitats is patchy
17:08
inside those patches of habitat you have a species and let's look at for instance fish it turns out that those fish
17:14
reproduce they produce eggs so not some fish some species produce eggs directly on the ribs
17:20
and once the egg is harsh then you get the larvae the larvae is then hanging
17:26
out in the water almost all the species of fish in the oceans release their larvae
17:31
into the ocean into the water column and then there is a time when the larvae is going to be moving around
17:37
there is going to be certain amount of time normally the time is about a month i want you to think about that why will
17:44
most of the species in the ocean know all of them but the great majority of species especially on places like coral
17:50
reefs the larval period lasts for about a month why would that be the case
17:55
the reason why is because once they get to that month they need to go back to
18:00
the reef and if they when they come back to the reef the moon is very bright they
18:06
get eaten by any fish that are there so these fish have a larval period that is long enough for
18:12
them to be able to settle on the darkest moments of the night just to avoid being eaten at night so it turns out that
18:18
again many species high about different strategies to last different durations while they are larva hanging out in the
18:24
ocean in the ocean in the open ocean you sort of had a good time there hard to get eaten although there is
18:30
going to be a time in the in the open water when you get to be too big and then you are going to get visible and then they are going to eat you and that
18:36
kind of force you to get out of the open water into a place that you can get more protection in the reef but you need to
18:42
really time very well that time because then you can potentially be eaten on the reef itself
18:48
so this is kind of the evolution on the dispersal of many many species in the ocean i just gave you the case example
18:53
of the larvae here but depending on the duration of that period that again most commonly is 30 days but it changes quite
19:00
a lot from species to species so species might might be able to reach further location locations are very far
19:06
so the idea was then that the species that had the longest dispersal periods
19:11
should have the largest geographical range it makes a lot of sense right like everything
19:17
starts with an idea the idea was terrific but then these two guys came in treasure
Treasure and Brothers
19:22
and brothers right those ones were the first one to test that idea whether the species depending on their the duration
19:29
of the larvae period will correlate with how big the geographical ranges are and they tested that hypothesis on this
19:35
group of fish that is called the pomacantide you see those species hanging out here in any reef in hawaii and here what they
19:44
did they calculated the time that this species lasts in the open water and the way to do that is they take something in
19:50
the brain that is called the otolith the otolet is a bone that they have inside the brain that is like an onion so
19:57
basically it's very small it's not that big depending on the species could be a couple millimeters and basically with a microscope and a sandpaper you cut that
20:06
thing until the middle and then what you ended up seeing is like an onion rings right and every ring on that otoli
20:13
represents commonly a day so they went and collected this fish from many places around the
20:18
pacific analyzed their outlets and calculated their larval period and then
20:24
they correlated that against the area that is occupied by the species the expectation was then that the species
20:30
that had the longest periods will have the largest geographical range but when they were going to put the data together it turns out that there was no
20:36
correlation at all to imagine the disappointment of these guys to be the first ones to test the
20:41
hypothesis again a cool idea when you put the data there was no correlation
20:46
later on many years later on uh benjamin victor and gerald wellington
20:53
they started to test the hypothesis again and they had different ways to maybe calculate the range they argue maybe these guys didn't calculate as
20:59
well maybe they didn't analyze the data and lose personal wealth they decided to redo the whole thing with a family that
21:04
is called elaborates these are the grasses that you see here in hawaii and they find no correlation whatsoever
21:11
but these guys decided to try it again this this has to be a correlation there has to be i mean it makes the most sense
21:18
so they decided to test the hypothesis on another paper with the pomaca with the pumas entry they and they found no correlation
21:24
either basically the conclusion of the many years of testing this was that the time
21:30
that the animals last in the oceans is not sufficient for them to define how big the
21:35
geographical range is many years later though i i was hanging out with a friend of
21:42
mine when i was doing my phd and we were intrigued about this question of why is it that the species
21:48
that had long dispersal don't have large geographical ranges an idea occurred to us that maybe what is
21:54
happening is that those species are too young so what we needed to do is to account for the evolutionary age of the
22:00
species again the same concept species that are very old that separated very long
22:05
ago they had had a lot of time to move around while species that are young could potentially higher smaller
22:11
geographical ranges and that could potentially again describe how big the geographical range of the species are so
22:17
what we decided to do was to collect all of these phylogenys that have been published on many of these species and try to calculate how
22:24
all the species are so many of these phylogeny is given the degree of difference the length of these
22:30
branches determine and the genetic difference of that unit species that then you can translate into time and
22:37
basically what we do then is take the philogenics to calculate how all the species are and in this one paper that
22:43
we published in ecography in 2011 we tested the hypothesis for the first time and we found no correlation we then went
22:51
and collected even more data on the dispersal during the larval period to put maybe the two things together with the idea
22:57
that maybe again there is an interaction between the evolutionary age and the pelagic larval period meaning that for
23:04
instance you might have species that are very old have maybe a very small
23:09
pelagic period so it doesn't really matter how old you are if your larval period is very short you will have no
23:15
time to move or it could be the opposite right maybe by you being so over so many
23:20
times eventually you might have made it many places and if in the opposite you might have
23:25
species that are very young that have very long larval periods that could potentially refund reach out most
23:32
of the ocean so there could be potentially an interaction again between how old you are as a species and the time that you're spending the water
23:38
dispersing and how that interaction determines the geographical range we were super excited collecting this data
23:44
and then after a strong analysis we found that there was no correlation whatsoever we decided to test that in a
23:50
couple of species in grasses and puma centuries for which there was a lot of data and we found no correlation whatsoever
23:57
so that was very puzzling to us that neither the time since the species was originated nor the
24:04
time that it takes to disperse are sufficient drivers of how big the geographical range of the species are
24:10
another thing that we decided to test though is that maybe the reason why
24:15
the dispersal doesn't have an effect on the geographical range is because
24:22
the the geomorphology doesn't allow for dispersal to have an effect let me elaborate on this
24:28
so basically what happens is that the magnitude of dispersal
24:34
and how dispersal is really going to constrain the geographical range or not depends on the geographical setting
24:40
where you are right so here is an example where you had a huge gap in space you obviously need to have a huge
24:47
geographical a huge larval period to go from here to here but once you get here
24:52
the relevant period that you need is not that long basically what we are talking about here is that
24:58
they gotta be a a trade-off this this effect sorry or dispersal is a function
25:05
of the geographical isolation of the places again this person will only play
25:10
a role on the geographical range of the species in environmental setting geographical
25:15
settings where the the geography of the habitat again restricts where the species can be found
25:21
kind of complicated thing to do but what we decided to do was to model the distribution of larvae from everywhere
25:27
around the world we use about 3 000 computers to run these simulations and what you can see here
25:32
is another paper another simulation that we publish in this one paper here and we which release larvae from every
25:39
reef in the world we talk every coral reef in the world from a satellite image and we assumed that fish were born there
25:44
and then we released these molecules into the water using actual simulations of the currents that you can see there
25:50
so you can see how for instance fish from the galapagos island start dispersing and this is 20 years 22 days
25:56
25 days 26 days so every day what we did was to to disperse this
26:02
molecule just to see where the molecules go and what we did then was to again come
26:08
up with these patterns here so what this top map is is the spatial insulation
26:14
from any reef to the nearest reef and as you can see in the pacific ocean the largest spatial isolation is here in the
26:20
in the pacific in the center here in the upper north atlantic so they are for instance 1500 kilometers
26:27
to the closest reef from this place so basically you are dumb drop here in this
26:32
area of the pacific atlantic the closest reef is 1500 kilometers away from you okay
26:39
now if it turns out that you are dumped there in that part of the ocean you are going to be moved by the corn so if you
26:45
are possibly moved by the occurrence of the speed of the currents for instance it will take 74 days
26:50
for you to be for you to reach the closest rate so i want you to remember this so in any
26:56
time that you are for instance find yourself lost in the oceans the longest that it will take for you to
27:03
go from wherever you are to the closest reef is 74 days so hopefully you get enough food there to last to get to that
27:09
time but what we did now now that we have the distances
27:15
of the time sorry that it takes to go from any place in the world to the closest reef we compared that to the
27:21
larval dispersals of the fish and what we found was this map here in which you can see the proportion of species that
27:27
are filtered by the time that it takes to move to places what we found here is
27:32
that you see in blue almost any place in the world coastal reef can be reached by
27:39
most of the species right again the idea is that as i explained to you most of the species last 30 days but
27:46
it turns out that 30 days is enough for you to reach most of the nearest place anywhere in
27:51
the world i know where obviously several generations that's going to be sufficient for you to be found everywhere and that explains
27:58
according to what we explain in this paper why is it that dispersal doesn't influence the geographical range it's
28:05
because there is no geographical isolation to prevent the species getting those getting to those places within the time
28:11
that allows the the dispersal period
28:17
well again while this paper explains why your dispersal doesn't affect the range
28:22
unfortunately it doesn't still explain why is it that the species had the range that it does we're still kind of still
28:28
trying to answer that question there so again when it comes down to why the speech is at the range that it does
Why the range
28:34
especially the science the reality is that we're still trying to find that out there are hundreds of hypotheses that
28:40
have been proposed some hypotheses explain certain areas or boundaries of the range but there is no
28:45
yet a cumulative explanation that explains very well why the range
28:52
is the way that it is as i explained at the end of the class another interesting hypothesis question
28:58
sorry as it comes down to biogeography studying by the geographical range is the fact that most of the species in the
29:04
world have small ranges and here you can see for instance this is the geographical range here you had a
29:11
small ranges here you had huge ranges around this axis you had the number of species so you can see that there's
29:17
always a very large number of species that had small ranges and very few species that had very large ranges the
29:24
question is why that's the case so first of all i want to point out that
29:30
that distribution that i just described to you obviously changes from place to place there's a paper by grabber and
29:35
rabbit in pnas and here what they did was to analyze for instance the mean geographical range of the species so
29:41
here you can see for instance how the mean range of the species along the coast is relatively small well most of
29:47
the species here on this area had on average larger graphical regions and we explained that earlier on
29:54
the reason being most likely here that again the hmong times create environmental conditions that make most
29:59
of the species on those places to have small geographical ranges and that explains why then gravis here found that
30:05
most of the species here had small ranges here the habitat is more homogeneous and that could explain why
30:11
then they find that most of the species here on average have large geographical ranges that again is to to describe to
30:16
you that is part of the distribution of the species on play by range size changes from place from
30:23
place to place with that being said though in general this is the pattern again most of the
30:28
species are small ranges but if you have large ranges there is a guy a professor called kevin gaston super nice guy i
30:35
have published a couple papers with him he's in london in england he has the paper there where he
30:41
suggested multiple hypotheses to explain why this pattern is the way it is the first one
30:46
is a speciation obviously when most of the species are originated they originate
30:52
most likely most commonly starting from a small place right so that will explain why most of the species are small ranges
30:58
because those species are relatively new and again when they originate most likely they start with a small range
31:06
the other explanation that he suggests is an extinction effect on the species that have large ranges obviously when
31:12
you start having capacity to disperse too many places the chances that on all of
31:18
those places you are going to have suitable conditions are going to be very rare as a result chances are that you are going to be it's going to be very
31:24
hard for you to be found everywhere so basically there is an extinction effect on the climatic or environmental
31:30
conditions in some places that prevent most of the species of having huge geographical ranges
31:37
and again it could also be a dispersal effect again it's not only that once you
31:42
get there you get to face in conditions are not suitable that make you die but it's also the fact that maybe there are
31:48
very few species with a dispersal capacity to to get everywhere
31:55
there is another hypothesis to explain the distribution this is a paper that i published with ross robertson from the
32:01
smithsonian in panama what we did here was to analyze all of the fish from the inside pacific and this is the
32:07
distribution of the ranges the geographical ranges of those species right so here you have all of the
32:12
species of fish in that region and this is the geographical range one of the things that you can see right away is exactly what everybody has found which
32:19
is that most of the species has small ranges but one of the interesting things on this region is this peak here at high
32:27
ranges so in that region in terms of there are actually quite a few species that also have large ranges so that's an
32:33
intriguing finding a modification of the pattern that everybody has found the way that we tried to explain this
32:39
pattern was like this when you take a species about where they are found and basically
32:46
here you have species that are continental found everywhere along the continent or species are found only on islands when we separate those species
32:53
what we found is that all these species that are found only on islands are endemic so this peak that you find here
33:00
is mostly related to the fact that these species are found on those oceanic islands it makes a lot of sense right so
33:06
imagine that you are born on that island as a new species but unfortunately you are so far away from anything close that
33:12
you get stuck on that island that will explain again why most of the species have small geographical ranges
33:19
now when you look at the species that are found only along the continent that actually explains
33:26
it is random you see there's like no pattern to this but when you analyze
33:32
the species that are found on islands that are also found on the continents what does that tell you
33:38
right you think about this there is a species that is found on an island that is found on the continent regardless of where it was born
33:44
that far along that the species is found on that oceanic island and in a continent suggests that that species had a huge potential for dispersal because
33:52
if it was born on the island obviously it has the special capacity to get to the continent but if it was originating
33:58
the continent it has the capacity to then also disperse to that island so species are found in continental
34:05
islands that are also found on australia sorry along the continent that also found on oceanic islands had a
34:11
huge potential for dispersal so what we decided to do is to look at the arrangements of those species just to see what happened what we found
34:17
there was though that this rare peak of a species with large ranges are again
34:23
the subset of species that are found on continents and islands and that explains the second pig that we found here so
34:29
this paper has been kind of interesting in the sense that we found a pattern that is
34:35
kind of different in the sense that there you find only species that have large geographical ranges but the other thing that we documented with this paper
34:42
is again the significance of the dispersal capacity of a species combined with the geomorphology of the places
34:48
where the species are found and it appears that the combination of these two factors again determine
34:53
how commonly you see a species we like with small ranges or species with large ranges
Summary
34:59
all right let's summarize the entire class for today the range sizes so the species are
35:04
viable that's a fact as that at the individual level of course
35:10
why this species had the range that it does there's some evidence to suggest that it could be the environment there are
35:16
ecological interactions those two factors are related to the niche indeed while these factors are important for
35:22
you to determine what the species found it doesn't seem to be determining all of the areas where the species can reach so
35:29
it's very likely that this niche determine the outermost boundaries of where the species can be
35:34
found but there is something else that restricted species within those suitable conditions another bible that has been analyzed is
35:41
evolution talking here about the isms of panama the other one is dispersal talking about
35:47
all these papers looking at the pelagic period or the evolutionary age of the species determining the geographical
35:52
range of the species at the individual level now when you take the geographical ranges of all of the species and combine
35:59
them together what you find most commonly is that most of the species have small ranges very few have large
36:05
ranges and as for why that's the case it could be a combination of a speciation extinction
36:11
the transformation and then dispersal or isolation that's the class for today and see you
36:16

Introduction
0:04
hello today we're going to be looking at the species geographical range
0:10
you were to look at a book for the definition of a geographical range is basically the spatial area which
0:15
populations of populations of organic species are found let me just describe that in a different way as i explained
0:23
earlier once a species originates one of the first things that it does is to disperse
0:28
trying to colonize areas beyond the original place up to a point where it can have colonized most of the areas
0:34
where it can survive mostly is add to those points when it faces conditions that prevent the species of moving
0:39
forward so once the species colonize most of the areas where it can be that area is what is called or what is
0:46
defined as the geographical range of the species
Definition of geographical range
0:51
but what do we mean by geographical range let's look at an example here this is the white shark and a scientist had
0:56
documented a white shark here on all of these points that you see in red scientists then take the outermost
1:04
locations and create a polygon around them and then that's what ended up becoming the geographical range again
1:10
the areas where the species can be found as you can potentially appreciate though there are some limitations to the use of
1:16
the geographical range in the case of the white chart for instance you can see that there are many places in the oceans where the sharks
1:24
are never there but in the according to the geographical range the way that we calculate the geographical range the
1:29
species are there so it creates this kind of situation that a scientist addressed by introducing two alternative
1:36
definitions for the geographical range one definition is what is called the extent of occurrence the state of
1:42
occurrence is actually the subset of areas where the species are found so in the center of occurrence what they do is
1:48
they outline for instance all of the locations here in the atlantic along the americas and in the atlantic in africa
1:55
and basically they accumulate all those areas and then that becomes the the area the extent of occurrence
2:01
against subsets of areas within the geographical range where the species found and the other
2:07
definition that they introduce is what is called the area of occupancy which is the area within the outermost limits of
2:13
that distribution basically that polygon that i show in there the outermost limits of where the species are found
2:20
and what is the area that is within that polygon that's what is called the area of occupancy
Why is geographical range important
2:26
this is that though by looking at why is the geographical range of a species an important attribute to a study the first
2:32
one is that it allows to quantify the extinction rays of a species right it's commonly understood that a species that
2:38
had a smaller geographical range as we described in another class those species are endemic they're at higher risk
2:44
because imagine that the species only found in hawaii and there is a hurricane that passes by hawaii the entire species
2:49
was seen as opposed to imagine a species that are found everywhere a cosmopolitan species if there is a hurricane
2:55
somewhere in the middle does not want to attract the species to extinction so it has been found that
3:00
there is a huge risk associated with the size of the geographical range most commonly with the species that are at
3:06
the highest smaller ranges being a higher risk and obviously then with the geographical
3:11
range we can figure out what could be the consequences of human impacts on biodiversity this is a paper by walter
3:18
jets in which he analyzed here the changes are projected by 2100 according to
3:23
language change and clan and climate change he put it together then you overlap that with the geographical
3:29
distribution of a species and then it allows you to identify again the extent to which different species are going to
3:35
be are going to have the geographical ranges restricted in size right so again
3:42
this is a case in which the geographical range becomes an important tool for you to identify the potential risks that we
3:47
are putting species under as a result of climate change the other thing is that it also allows
3:53
you to identify areas of vulnerability so if you imagine that managed to collect the geographical ranges of all the species in the world you start
3:59
looking at where are most of the species with the smallest ranges which we know are species that are average of extinction then you can potentially
4:05
prioritize in the protection of those places given the higher rates that they are so this is an example here by
4:10
granger in which they analyze the distribution of birds and you can see here places where
4:17
most of the species are found most where most of the species are found in those places are geographical ranges that are
4:23
small so again they allow you to identify or potentially prioritize places where species with smaller ranges
4:29
are found when it comes to the biogeographical range of the species
Two important research questions
4:34
in in by geography there are two important interesting research questions there are
4:39
obviously tens of them but two of them have kind of driven most of the attention of biogeographical research one of them
4:46
is why species had a range that it does why the species is the given size why aren't certain species are found only on
4:52
some places while osps are found everywhere and the second interesting question is when you combine all the
4:57
species the geographical ranges of all of these species one of the things that you find is that most of the species in
5:02
the world had smaller ranges and very few species had large geographical ranges so just think about that right so
5:09
you look at tiny fish in the oceans it turns out that most tiny fish in the oceans had only smaller ranges but if
5:15
you look at whales there are very few species of whales that are found everywhere well most of these fish there
5:20
are tons of those species found everywhere in the world but most of them are endemic to the place so that's kind of an interesting question by itself why
5:26
is it that when you look at nature overall most of the species are there normally had geographical ranges that
5:32
are small so here's an example for instance on a paper by ormond using pericles
Why is the range that size
5:39
let's start with the first question of why the species had the range that it does when you look at a geographical
5:45
range why is that range that size one of the first ideas that was proposed is this
5:51
idea of niche the idea of nature is as follow basically what happens is there is when you look at two environmental
5:57
gradients like air temperature or the availability of food there is going to be a place in the interaction between
6:03
those two areas where the species is going to be found or where it's going to have suitable conditions like for instance in this case let's imagine that
6:10
here is super cold for the species here is super hot there is not enough food here is a lot of food but it's too cold
6:15
there's going to be this sweet spot where the environmental conditions are excellent for the species to survive the
6:21
combination of this suitable condition is what is called the niche right so an extrapolation of that idea to the
6:28
geographical range suggests that the species are found when the environmental conditions are suitable for the species
6:33
to be found and again here here is an example looking at just temperature basically
6:40
again there is going to be a place where the species performs optimally and
6:46
as the temperature increases or decreases the performance of the species is going to decline and um there's multiple case examples
6:52
documenting that that's the case again here is a paper by bennett and huge that took that a fish and they expose it to
6:59
temperature and they find that there is this very optimum temperature like for instance above 12 degrees
7:05
celsius which is fish survive well um anything that is lower than 12 the species
7:11
doesn't survive well so that the fact that the species can only live up to 12 degrees allows the species then to
7:17
survive in places that have more than 12 degrees temperature
7:23
unfortunately this idea of the climate being the driving force obviously makes a lot of sense right the fact that you
7:28
can only live when the environmental conditions are good and that could potentially explain why the species had the range that it does unfortunately
7:34
when a scientist went and investigated that they don't it found that actually they found actually very little support
7:39
for that idea so here's an example of a species that i started back when i was an undergrad many years ago called
7:45
talasomalu and this is where the species is found this is color in blue and yellow and
7:51
green however when you look at the geograph at the environmental conditions of these
7:57
places where it is found one of the things that you find is what it is what is called the suitable area so basically
8:03
all of these environmental conditions here along the east pacific where the species found today are also found in
8:09
many other places in the world but when you look at the species where it's found the species only found here in the
8:14
instant pacific so that alone is an indication that there is something more to where the species are found than just
8:20
the environmental conditions because in this case example the same conditions here in the eastern pacific where the
8:26
species found are found everywhere else but the species is not found on those places so there is something else
8:32
that determines how far the species can go interestingly though even within our
8:39
region at times environmental battles are not sufficient to explain
8:45
where they are found this is a paper that i did many years ago when i was an undergrad again with thalassoma lucasano
8:51
and i what i did i took this fish i went and collected from the field i put them in these aquariums and i started cooling down the temperature until i found the
8:57
temperature at which the fish don't survive well the magic number was 16
9:02
degrees celsius but one of the things that you look along the continental coast of the united states is that along the
9:08
americas is that that species only from from here to here that's where the species found today but when you look at
9:14
16 degrees of temperature it turns out that 16 degrees of temperature is right there and 16 degrees of temperatures is
9:20
back there and the species only found on this area so basically what we have here is this huge area north this huge area
9:27
south where the temperatures are suitable for the fish to survive but the species is not there and again is
9:33
another indication that while the environment indeed can lead can determine the boundaries of the
9:38
geographical distribution there is something else that determines where the species are found
9:46
now another idea that has been proposed as in regards to the niche is there the potential role of ecological factors on
9:52
that niche so basically what happens here imagine that you had two species one species in red the other one is in
9:58
blue this is the resource and basically you have most of the individuals using the resource here
10:04
at this condition and here at these levels and when you have two species then
10:09
using the same resource it turns out that there's going to be an area where they are going to overlap and
10:15
in the area of overlapping you also want a species have to compete with individuals of the other species and they have to waste energy fighting
10:22
what's going to happen over time is that in that area the individuals are going to go extend because basically there are
10:27
other places where they can do much better without that competition so over time this eye of competition that i
10:34
indicate here in orange when one species interact with the other species in the use of that resource
10:40
that competition will reduce the thinness of the individuals there as a result the species will specialize
10:47
right to use certain areas of the risk of the resource and avoiding that competition there that's kind of the
10:52
theory on this so as a result it has been suggested that this could be extrapolated to the geographical range
10:57
to then explain that by ecological reasons then could potentially exclude a species
11:03
from some places and then determine whether species are present on those locations or not unfortunately when this analysis was
11:10
done it was found that that might not be totally the case this is a famous paper by a big guy called macarthur robert
11:17
mccarthy he is one of the godfathers so to speak in ecology and he came out
11:23
with this idea that indeed this competition can indeed happen but rather than the
11:28
species going extinct what they do is to optimize the use of the resources
11:33
specializing on different places so what you ended up with is a species sharing the same places here as an example he
11:40
studied these birds and what he found in the case of the birds the they all used the same tree but now what they have
11:46
done is to specialize at different heights of the tree using different resources as a result they can coexist
11:52
in the same tree so while ecological interactions can indeed drive the local
11:58
distribution of a species it's very unlikely that these ecological interactions will determine the geographical distribution of species
12:04
again because in this case species managed to coexist
12:13
now another possibility for why the geographical range of a species is the way or the size of the shape that it is
12:19
is evolution let me analyze another case example here with the same fish that we showed talked before the thalassoma
12:25
lucas and from the eastern pacific so if you look at the geomorphology of the pacific and atlantic ocean it turns
12:32
out that back in the day 10 million years ago it was connected there was a big bridge between the two of them and
12:37
then because of plate tectonics and the the isms of panama started going up and eventually it separated the pacific from
12:44
the atlantic and that happened about 3 million years ago so 3 million years ago the pacific was separated
12:51
from the atlantic thanks to the eastmans of panama now you build the phylogeny of thalassoma lucas is playing one of the
12:58
prior classes basically looking at the relationship between talasomal casano and many other species one of the things
13:03
that you will discover so this is the phylogeny it was known by a guy como bernardi i think that he's at
13:08
the university of california he built the actual phylogeny of this guy and here he related that to the philosophy
13:15
of many other species and here is talasumalu one of the interesting discoveries of this philogenic is that when you look at
13:21
when talasomalu casanov was separated from their ancestral ancestors that was
13:26
three million years ago exactly the time when the isms of panama separated the pacific from the atlantic so one
13:33
possibility here for why the the the grass
13:39
is not in the caribbean is because by the time that it was born in that in the pacific there was the panama already
13:45
there the panama the panama is most of panama so he couldn't move to the caribbean so in this case evolution and
13:52
geomorphological changes over time are potentially a good way to explain why sony species are not found where they
13:57
are found as here in the case of the thalassoma it might it's possible that
14:02
it might not be found in the caribbean because by the time that it was born the pacific was already separated from the
14:08
atlantic and unfortunately for the guy he was born in the atlanta in the pacific
Transport
14:16
so another explanation that has been proposed to explain why species are where they
14:22
are is transport this is a paper here by these two guys here gaylor and gaines i think that games is at the university of
14:29
california i might be wrong about that but here they had this very clever paper where they found that maybe the
14:35
distribution of species can be constrained by changes in the direction of currents so basically what happens
14:41
for instance if you look at us an example here at the cause of the pacific coast of the americas moving from the north towards the
14:48
tropics is the california current because of the way that the the planet moves this current shifts
14:54
towards the central pacific in about the gulf of california and there is a similar current happening
15:00
at north what is called the peruvian current the peruvian current move along the coast of south america and it turns
15:06
towards the central pacific at about peru right and that again is determined by the way that the planet
15:12
moves so what they argue then is that for many species these storms on the changes in the
15:19
direction of the currents become boundaries for the distribution of a species when you look at something like that lucasarum for instance this
15:26
actually is a super good explanation for why that species is not found in higher latitudes despite the fact that the
15:31
temperatures are suitable it's simply the fact that it cannot migrate so you remember the
15:38
species born but then he had to move in this case if he was born in the tropics he got he wants to move a higher
15:44
latitude unfortunately the currents here are pushing the species down towards the tropics so in this case the opposite
15:50
currents prevent the species of moving south or north so this is a very clever
15:55
paper by by gaylor and gaines that's what is again the distribution of many spaces in many
16:01
species in the world especially in the oceans are restricted by changes in the erection of these currents
16:07
however currents alone are not the whole story because then if that's true that currents determine where the species are
16:14
then how is it that this species is not found in the central pacific when you have that current moving exactly in that
16:20
direction so basically these corners will take all of these species from the eastern pacific into the central pacific
16:26
but those species from here are not found there so transport again helps to some degree
16:32
explain sort of the boundaries of the range but not all of them another explanation that has been
Dispersion
16:38
proposed a lot to explain the geographical range of species is dispersal the idea being that different
16:45
species had different capacities to disperse so depending on the capacity of a species some can move reach farther
16:52
places than others let me just give you those some background information on how the species disperse especially in the
16:58
oceans and the great majority of species in the oceans when we look at sustrata
17:03
in the oceans it turns out that most of the distribution of those habitats is patchy
17:08
inside those patches of habitat you have a species and let's look at for instance fish it turns out that those fish
17:14
reproduce they produce eggs so not some fish some species produce eggs directly on the ribs
17:20
and once the egg is harsh then you get the larvae the larvae is then hanging
17:26
out in the water almost all the species of fish in the oceans release their larvae
17:31
into the ocean into the water column and then there is a time when the larvae is going to be moving around
17:37
there is going to be certain amount of time normally the time is about a month i want you to think about that why will
17:44
most of the species in the ocean know all of them but the great majority of species especially on places like coral
17:50
reefs the larval period lasts for about a month why would that be the case
17:55
the reason why is because once they get to that month they need to go back to
18:00
the reef and if they when they come back to the reef the moon is very bright they
18:06
get eaten by any fish that are there so these fish have a larval period that is long enough for
18:12
them to be able to settle on the darkest moments of the night just to avoid being eaten at night so it turns out that
18:18
again many species high about different strategies to last different durations while they are larva hanging out in the
18:24
ocean in the ocean in the open ocean you sort of had a good time there hard to get eaten although there is
18:30
going to be a time in the in the open water when you get to be too big and then you are going to get visible and then they are going to eat you and that
18:36
kind of force you to get out of the open water into a place that you can get more protection in the reef but you need to
18:42
really time very well that time because then you can potentially be eaten on the reef itself
18:48
so this is kind of the evolution on the dispersal of many many species in the ocean i just gave you the case example
18:53
of the larvae here but depending on the duration of that period that again most commonly is 30 days but it changes quite
19:00
a lot from species to species so species might might be able to reach further location locations are very far
19:06
so the idea was then that the species that had the longest dispersal periods
19:11
should have the largest geographical range it makes a lot of sense right like everything
19:17
starts with an idea the idea was terrific but then these two guys came in treasure
Treasure and Brothers
19:22
and brothers right those ones were the first one to test that idea whether the species depending on their the duration
19:29
of the larvae period will correlate with how big the geographical ranges are and they tested that hypothesis on this
19:35
group of fish that is called the pomacantide you see those species hanging out here in any reef in hawaii and here what they
19:44
did they calculated the time that this species lasts in the open water and the way to do that is they take something in
19:50
the brain that is called the otolith the otolet is a bone that they have inside the brain that is like an onion so
19:57
basically it's very small it's not that big depending on the species could be a couple millimeters and basically with a microscope and a sandpaper you cut that
20:06
thing until the middle and then what you ended up seeing is like an onion rings right and every ring on that otoli
20:13
represents commonly a day so they went and collected this fish from many places around the
20:18
pacific analyzed their outlets and calculated their larval period and then
20:24
they correlated that against the area that is occupied by the species the expectation was then that the species
20:30
that had the longest periods will have the largest geographical range but when they were going to put the data together it turns out that there was no
20:36
correlation at all to imagine the disappointment of these guys to be the first ones to test the
20:41
hypothesis again a cool idea when you put the data there was no correlation
20:46
later on many years later on uh benjamin victor and gerald wellington
20:53
they started to test the hypothesis again and they had different ways to maybe calculate the range they argue maybe these guys didn't calculate as
20:59
well maybe they didn't analyze the data and lose personal wealth they decided to redo the whole thing with a family that
21:04
is called elaborates these are the grasses that you see here in hawaii and they find no correlation whatsoever
21:11
but these guys decided to try it again this this has to be a correlation there has to be i mean it makes the most sense
21:18
so they decided to test the hypothesis on another paper with the pomaca with the pumas entry they and they found no correlation
21:24
either basically the conclusion of the many years of testing this was that the time
21:30
that the animals last in the oceans is not sufficient for them to define how big the
21:35
geographical range is many years later though i i was hanging out with a friend of
21:42
mine when i was doing my phd and we were intrigued about this question of why is it that the species
21:48
that had long dispersal don't have large geographical ranges an idea occurred to us that maybe what is
21:54
happening is that those species are too young so what we needed to do is to account for the evolutionary age of the
22:00
species again the same concept species that are very old that separated very long
22:05
ago they had had a lot of time to move around while species that are young could potentially higher smaller
22:11
geographical ranges and that could potentially again describe how big the geographical range of the species are so
22:17
what we decided to do was to collect all of these phylogenys that have been published on many of these species and try to calculate how
22:24
all the species are so many of these phylogeny is given the degree of difference the length of these
22:30
branches determine and the genetic difference of that unit species that then you can translate into time and
22:37
basically what we do then is take the philogenics to calculate how all the species are and in this one paper that
22:43
we published in ecography in 2011 we tested the hypothesis for the first time and we found no correlation we then went
22:51
and collected even more data on the dispersal during the larval period to put maybe the two things together with the idea
22:57
that maybe again there is an interaction between the evolutionary age and the pelagic larval period meaning that for
23:04
instance you might have species that are very old have maybe a very small
23:09
pelagic period so it doesn't really matter how old you are if your larval period is very short you will have no
23:15
time to move or it could be the opposite right maybe by you being so over so many
23:20
times eventually you might have made it many places and if in the opposite you might have
23:25
species that are very young that have very long larval periods that could potentially refund reach out most
23:32
of the ocean so there could be potentially an interaction again between how old you are as a species and the time that you're spending the water
23:38
dispersing and how that interaction determines the geographical range we were super excited collecting this data
23:44
and then after a strong analysis we found that there was no correlation whatsoever we decided to test that in a
23:50
couple of species in grasses and puma centuries for which there was a lot of data and we found no correlation whatsoever
23:57
so that was very puzzling to us that neither the time since the species was originated nor the
24:04
time that it takes to disperse are sufficient drivers of how big the geographical range of the species are
24:10
another thing that we decided to test though is that maybe the reason why
24:15
the dispersal doesn't have an effect on the geographical range is because
24:22
the the geomorphology doesn't allow for dispersal to have an effect let me elaborate on this
24:28
so basically what happens is that the magnitude of dispersal
24:34
and how dispersal is really going to constrain the geographical range or not depends on the geographical setting
24:40
where you are right so here is an example where you had a huge gap in space you obviously need to have a huge
24:47
geographical a huge larval period to go from here to here but once you get here
24:52
the relevant period that you need is not that long basically what we are talking about here is that
24:58
they gotta be a a trade-off this this effect sorry or dispersal is a function
25:05
of the geographical isolation of the places again this person will only play
25:10
a role on the geographical range of the species in environmental setting geographical
25:15
settings where the the geography of the habitat again restricts where the species can be found
25:21
kind of complicated thing to do but what we decided to do was to model the distribution of larvae from everywhere
25:27
around the world we use about 3 000 computers to run these simulations and what you can see here
25:32
is another paper another simulation that we publish in this one paper here and we which release larvae from every
25:39
reef in the world we talk every coral reef in the world from a satellite image and we assumed that fish were born there
25:44
and then we released these molecules into the water using actual simulations of the currents that you can see there
25:50
so you can see how for instance fish from the galapagos island start dispersing and this is 20 years 22 days
25:56
25 days 26 days so every day what we did was to to disperse this
26:02
molecule just to see where the molecules go and what we did then was to again come
26:08
up with these patterns here so what this top map is is the spatial insulation
26:14
from any reef to the nearest reef and as you can see in the pacific ocean the largest spatial isolation is here in the
26:20
in the pacific in the center here in the upper north atlantic so they are for instance 1500 kilometers
26:27
to the closest reef from this place so basically you are dumb drop here in this
26:32
area of the pacific atlantic the closest reef is 1500 kilometers away from you okay
26:39
now if it turns out that you are dumped there in that part of the ocean you are going to be moved by the corn so if you
26:45
are possibly moved by the occurrence of the speed of the currents for instance it will take 74 days
26:50
for you to be for you to reach the closest rate so i want you to remember this so in any
26:56
time that you are for instance find yourself lost in the oceans the longest that it will take for you to
27:03
go from wherever you are to the closest reef is 74 days so hopefully you get enough food there to last to get to that
27:09
time but what we did now now that we have the distances
27:15
of the time sorry that it takes to go from any place in the world to the closest reef we compared that to the
27:21
larval dispersals of the fish and what we found was this map here in which you can see the proportion of species that
27:27
are filtered by the time that it takes to move to places what we found here is
27:32
that you see in blue almost any place in the world coastal reef can be reached by
27:39
most of the species right again the idea is that as i explained to you most of the species last 30 days but
27:46
it turns out that 30 days is enough for you to reach most of the nearest place anywhere in
27:51
the world i know where obviously several generations that's going to be sufficient for you to be found everywhere and that explains
27:58
according to what we explain in this paper why is it that dispersal doesn't influence the geographical range it's
28:05
because there is no geographical isolation to prevent the species getting those getting to those places within the time
28:11
that allows the the dispersal period
28:17
well again while this paper explains why your dispersal doesn't affect the range
28:22
unfortunately it doesn't still explain why is it that the species had the range that it does we're still kind of still
28:28
trying to answer that question there so again when it comes down to why the speech is at the range that it does
Why the range
28:34
especially the science the reality is that we're still trying to find that out there are hundreds of hypotheses that
28:40
have been proposed some hypotheses explain certain areas or boundaries of the range but there is no
28:45
yet a cumulative explanation that explains very well why the range
28:52
is the way that it is as i explained at the end of the class another interesting hypothesis question
28:58
sorry as it comes down to biogeography studying by the geographical range is the fact that most of the species in the
29:04
world have small ranges and here you can see for instance this is the geographical range here you had a
29:11
small ranges here you had huge ranges around this axis you had the number of species so you can see that there's
29:17
always a very large number of species that had small ranges and very few species that had very large ranges the
29:24
question is why that's the case so first of all i want to point out that
29:30
that distribution that i just described to you obviously changes from place to place there's a paper by grabber and
29:35
rabbit in pnas and here what they did was to analyze for instance the mean geographical range of the species so
29:41
here you can see for instance how the mean range of the species along the coast is relatively small well most of
29:47
the species here on this area had on average larger graphical regions and we explained that earlier on
29:54
the reason being most likely here that again the hmong times create environmental conditions that make most
29:59
of the species on those places to have small geographical ranges and that explains why then gravis here found that
30:05
most of the species here had small ranges here the habitat is more homogeneous and that could explain why
30:11
then they find that most of the species here on average have large geographical ranges that again is to to describe to
30:16
you that is part of the distribution of the species on play by range size changes from place from
30:23
place to place with that being said though in general this is the pattern again most of the
30:28
species are small ranges but if you have large ranges there is a guy a professor called kevin gaston super nice guy i
30:35
have published a couple papers with him he's in london in england he has the paper there where he
30:41
suggested multiple hypotheses to explain why this pattern is the way it is the first one
30:46
is a speciation obviously when most of the species are originated they originate
30:52
most likely most commonly starting from a small place right so that will explain why most of the species are small ranges
30:58
because those species are relatively new and again when they originate most likely they start with a small range
31:06
the other explanation that he suggests is an extinction effect on the species that have large ranges obviously when
31:12
you start having capacity to disperse too many places the chances that on all of
31:18
those places you are going to have suitable conditions are going to be very rare as a result chances are that you are going to be it's going to be very
31:24
hard for you to be found everywhere so basically there is an extinction effect on the climatic or environmental
31:30
conditions in some places that prevent most of the species of having huge geographical ranges
31:37
and again it could also be a dispersal effect again it's not only that once you
31:42
get there you get to face in conditions are not suitable that make you die but it's also the fact that maybe there are
31:48
very few species with a dispersal capacity to to get everywhere
31:55
there is another hypothesis to explain the distribution this is a paper that i published with ross robertson from the
32:01
smithsonian in panama what we did here was to analyze all of the fish from the inside pacific and this is the
32:07
distribution of the ranges the geographical ranges of those species right so here you have all of the
32:12
species of fish in that region and this is the geographical range one of the things that you can see right away is exactly what everybody has found which
32:19
is that most of the species has small ranges but one of the interesting things on this region is this peak here at high
32:27
ranges so in that region in terms of there are actually quite a few species that also have large ranges so that's an
32:33
intriguing finding a modification of the pattern that everybody has found the way that we tried to explain this
32:39
pattern was like this when you take a species about where they are found and basically
32:46
here you have species that are continental found everywhere along the continent or species are found only on islands when we separate those species
32:53
what we found is that all these species that are found only on islands are endemic so this peak that you find here
33:00
is mostly related to the fact that these species are found on those oceanic islands it makes a lot of sense right so
33:06
imagine that you are born on that island as a new species but unfortunately you are so far away from anything close that
33:12
you get stuck on that island that will explain again why most of the species have small geographical ranges
33:19
now when you look at the species that are found only along the continent that actually explains
33:26
it is random you see there's like no pattern to this but when you analyze
33:32
the species that are found on islands that are also found on the continents what does that tell you
33:38
right you think about this there is a species that is found on an island that is found on the continent regardless of where it was born
33:44
that far along that the species is found on that oceanic island and in a continent suggests that that species had a huge potential for dispersal because
33:52
if it was born on the island obviously it has the special capacity to get to the continent but if it was originating
33:58
the continent it has the capacity to then also disperse to that island so species are found in continental
34:05
islands that are also found on australia sorry along the continent that also found on oceanic islands had a
34:11
huge potential for dispersal so what we decided to do is to look at the arrangements of those species just to see what happened what we found
34:17
there was though that this rare peak of a species with large ranges are again
34:23
the subset of species that are found on continents and islands and that explains the second pig that we found here so
34:29
this paper has been kind of interesting in the sense that we found a pattern that is
34:35
kind of different in the sense that there you find only species that have large geographical ranges but the other thing that we documented with this paper
34:42
is again the significance of the dispersal capacity of a species combined with the geomorphology of the places
34:48
where the species are found and it appears that the combination of these two factors again determine
34:53
how commonly you see a species we like with small ranges or species with large ranges
Summary
34:59
all right let's summarize the entire class for today the range sizes so the species are
35:04
viable that's a fact as that at the individual level of course
35:10
why this species had the range that it does there's some evidence to suggest that it could be the environment there are
35:16
ecological interactions those two factors are related to the niche indeed while these factors are important for
35:22
you to determine what the species found it doesn't seem to be determining all of the areas where the species can reach so
35:29
it's very likely that this niche determine the outermost boundaries of where the species can be
35:34
found but there is something else that restricted species within those suitable conditions another bible that has been analyzed is
35:41
evolution talking here about the isms of panama the other one is dispersal talking about
35:47
all these papers looking at the pelagic period or the evolutionary age of the species determining the geographical
35:52
range of the species at the individual level now when you take the geographical ranges of all of the species and combine
35:59
them together what you find most commonly is that most of the species have small ranges very few have large
36:05
ranges and as for why that's the case it could be a combination of a speciation extinction
36:11
the transformation and then dispersal or isolation that's the class for today and see you
