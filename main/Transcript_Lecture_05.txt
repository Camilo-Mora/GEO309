
0:06
all right so today we are going to be
0:08
covering uh another aspect
0:11
of um
0:13
that is another thing that is a study in
0:14
the field about geographical
0:16
biogeographical regions basically the
0:18
problem that we had here is the fact
0:20
that different parts of the world had
0:22
similar types of species right and
0:26
the problem is how do we set the
0:28
boundaries or those places right so let
0:31
me just give you an example here for you
0:33
to understand what i'm talking about you
0:34
look at these two places this is a
0:36
forest in costa rica there's a place a
0:38
forest in new england you can see that
0:40
from
0:42
by looking at them you can see that they
0:43
look very similar right you have forest
0:45
you have cloud you have trees but it
0:47
turns out that when you look at the
0:48
species of those two different places
0:50
they actually don't share any species so
0:52
how do you how do you go about ensuring
0:55
that those places are
0:57
we in the same place well it turns out
0:59
that you gotta do a couple distinctions
1:01
here the first one is to understand the
1:04
center which they are similar these
1:05
places are similar based on their
1:07
vegetation type structure climate so etc
1:10
or the strength to which they are
1:11
differentiated by the species that
1:13
belong to those different places
1:15
scientists
1:17
have created different ways to again
1:19
cluster these places depending on this
1:22
so anytime that you try to cluster
1:24
different places on the world based on
1:25
their vegetation type structural climate
1:27
so that is what is called a biome
1:30
okay so in this case these two places in
1:33
costa rica new caledonia again they
1:35
probably have the same temperature the
1:36
same water regimes and things like that
1:38
they are probably part of the same biome
1:39
because those climates are very similar
1:41
but there are no
1:43
but another way to classify those
1:44
species based on the similarities
1:46
between those two species in that case
1:49
scientists use what is called a
1:51
biogeographical region and again are
1:53
places on the planet that are clustered
1:56
together given in the similarity in
1:58
those places in for instance the plants
2:00
are animals that live within those
2:02
places in this case
2:04
these two examples here might be the
2:05
same biome because again same
2:07
temperatures and vegetation type and
2:09
things like that but there are probably
2:11
different biogeographical regions
2:13
because the species are here are not
2:14
there
2:15
so i need you to remember those two key
2:17
words there again biomes are places on
2:20
the world that are similar on their
2:21
climates
2:22
biogeographical regions are places in
2:24
the world that are similar on the
2:25
species that belong on those are on
2:27
those places
2:29
let's look at the data how people
2:31
outline the boundaries though those
2:32
biogeographical regions you know
2:35
so as i explained to you several times
2:38
in this class a species basically can
2:41
either be present on a place or might be
2:43
absent on that place the way that you
2:45
explain the presence of the space
2:48
the presence of a species is via
2:50
speciation the species being born in the
2:51
given place or via dispersal basically
2:54
the species got there from somewhere
2:55
else the way that you explain the
2:58
absence of a species can also be
3:00
be a extinction meaning that the species
3:02
was there and it wouldn't stain and
3:03
that's the reason why you don't see it
3:04
anymore or maybe dispersal limitations
3:07
that prevent the species of ever getting
3:09
to those places so with that being said
3:13
let's see what is the raw data that any
3:15
scientists use
3:17
to describe these biogeographical
3:18
regions and let's imagine here a
3:20
latitudinal gradient transit okay so
3:23
imagine that this is the normal these
3:25
are the tropics and that's the south
3:26
pole basically what i do then
3:29
what you find along the latitudinal
3:31
gradient is what is called geographical
3:33
range i'm going to describe a
3:35
geographical range as this black line
3:37
here so this is one species that is
3:38
found all the way from the north pole
3:40
all the way to the south pole so along
3:42
my transit the species is found
3:43
everywhere
3:45
just for you to know those species that
3:47
are found everywhere are where are we
3:49
are called cosmopolitan species i need
3:51
you to remember that name cosmopolitan
3:53
species are species that are found
3:55
everywhere
3:56
along the same that you do in a transit
3:58
you might find species are found only in
4:00
certain places those species are called
4:02
endemic species so cosmopolitan and
4:04
endemic are the species are kind of at
4:06
the stream of the geographical ranges
4:08
from the species that had a distribution
4:10
everywhere like cosmopolitan to species
4:13
that have very restricted limit a very
4:16
restricted distribution like species
4:18
that are endemic and in between that
4:19
range you have a species with all kind
4:21
of geographical ranges so here's an
4:23
example for instance or many species
4:26
that overlap the geographical ranges
4:28
along these latitude transit so that's
4:29
the reality of what happens in nature
4:31
right
4:33
now let's imagine that i go along this
4:35
transit and i do sampling on these
4:37
vertical on these lines that are here in
4:40
red so basically if i go to this place i
4:43
find two species if i go to this place i
4:45
find two species if i go to this place i
4:47
find three species right so again this
4:50
is using any of the method that we
4:51
described before i go to again every one
4:53
of these transits and then i for
4:55
instance go and count how many species
4:56
are there here i will find two here on
4:58
this position i find three i put three
5:00
there here five i put five there and
5:02
then if i were just to count
5:05
the species i will get what is called
5:07
the pattern of specie richness however
5:09
another thing that i can do is to
5:10
calculate the similarity between those
5:13
places so for instance in this case this
5:16
location has two species this location
5:19
has two species but you see are the same
5:21
species so in this case the similarity
5:23
between this location and that location
5:24
is 100 so i can rather plot the
5:27
similarity as well rather than counting
5:29
the species i can count how similar
5:31
those places are in this location
5:33
compared to that location you see there
5:35
is only one species in common this one
5:37
has one species that is
5:40
unique to the place but this other
5:41
location has two species that are unique
5:43
to the place so there are several
5:44
mathematical equations that allow you
5:46
then to calculate the similarity and
5:48
rather that you point in the number of
5:50
species what you calculate is the
5:52
similarity between neighboring locations
5:54
and you end up with parties like this
5:56
right so for instance in this case
5:58
if i went from this location to that
6:00
location they are very dissimilar so
6:01
they will be you will see dips and
6:03
basically what this outline then are
6:05
potentially boundaries on the
6:07
geographical distribution of a species
6:09
you see from this point over here
6:11
although there is a high similarity but
6:13
from that point between this and that
6:15
one they are very dissimilar and we in
6:17
that beyond that point everything is
6:19
similar so what that suggests here is
6:20
that there is a biogeographical
6:22
biogeographical boundary that prevents
6:25
species from this place to move into
6:26
that place so here you get hints into
6:29
the potential existence of
6:32
boundaries
6:33
again a scientist
6:35
use this data on the distribution of
6:37
species to look at the similarities
6:39
between the between locations and where
6:41
they are the most dissimilar
6:44
it gives hints into potential bond
6:47
boundaries of biogeographical regions
6:49
because obviously what is happening
6:50
there by the location being nearby in
6:52
locations being so the different is the
6:54
fact that something prevents the species
6:56
to go from go from one place to another
6:58
one so that's the way
7:00
how scientist take the raw data on a
7:02
species distribution and turn them into
7:04
similarities or dissimilarities to
7:06
outline the boundaries of
7:08
biogeographical regions
7:10
let's just review again let's actually
7:12
let's do a quick example here let's
7:13
imagine again the same latitudinal
7:15
transit here are the species and here
7:16
are two locations that i sampled so
7:18
mathematically there are different ways
7:20
to calculate how dissimilar they are one
7:23
method is what is called jacquard
7:25
index of similarity and is expressed
7:27
with a mathematical equation here s it
7:30
stands for a species the first number
7:33
stands for the species present in
7:35
location one
7:36
one stands for the species being present
7:38
and zero for the species being absent so
7:41
when you see that s11 s stands for the
7:43
species that are present in location one
7:45
that are also present in location two
7:48
so here if we look at this example here
7:50
so how many species are present in one
7:53
that are also present in location two
7:54
that will be four right so here i enter
7:57
my four now let's look at the
7:59
denominator of this
8:01
index and that is s01 so basically the
8:04
way that you read this is a species that
8:06
are absent
8:07
from psi one that are present inside two
8:11
right in that case you see there is not
8:14
a species that is absent from this side
8:16
that is present on that one so that will
8:17
become a zero
8:19
you do then the reverse for the other
8:20
side and finally you had s was one that
8:23
we established was again the species
8:24
that are present in one so location one
8:26
they're also present in location two
8:28
that will be four so that this the
8:30
similarity will be one so that's what is
8:32
called the jacquard
8:33
another common index to assess
8:35
similarities is what is called simpson
8:37
the question of simpson is actually
8:38
shorter is
8:40
is a
8:41
s11 divided by s1 so basically s11 is it
8:45
means the species present in location
8:47
one that are also present in location
8:48
two in this case that will be four
8:51
divided by the species that are present
8:53
in one location one that will be four so
8:55
the similarity is one so here are again
8:58
the two mathematical equations that are
9:00
used commonly to assess
9:02
the dissimilarity between places that at
9:04
times are used to define the boundaries
9:06
of biogeographical regions
9:09
let's look at an actual case example of
9:11
the similarity between places and how
9:14
they are used to align by geographical
9:15
regions this is a paper by mckinney
9:18
mack knight in plus biology biology in
9:20
2007 and he compared the similarities
9:23
between pixels
9:25
everywhere in the americas for birds
9:27
mammals and amphibians places that are
9:30
red are places that are very different
9:32
very dissimilar places that are in blue
9:35
are places that are very similar so
9:36
let's just look at one case example here
9:38
for the birds so you see for instance
9:40
look at the beauty the beauty of this
9:42
pattern how
9:44
all of the
9:45
pacific coast of the americas had had a
9:49
high species dissimilarity
9:52
i want you to talk about this while the
9:55
the other side of the americas normally
9:57
have a species location that are very
9:59
similar to each other i want you to pass
10:01
this video and think about why would
10:02
that be the case why the species
10:04
along the pacific coast of the americas
10:06
will be so different from place to place
10:09
while in the interior of the continent
10:11
those
10:12
species those sites have very similar
10:15
species compositions
10:17
so i'm hoping that you the explanation
10:19
that you came out with
10:21
is this so if you look at the
10:23
geomorphology of the americas what you
10:25
find along the pacific coast is a set of
10:27
mountains right that come from plate
10:29
tectonics that elevate the surface and
10:32
eventually you get these huge mountains
10:33
and what happens in mount times of
10:34
course is that it creates huge gradients
10:37
in the environment you can go from
10:38
hanging out on the beach with a nice
10:40
bikini and a martini all the way to
10:42
freezing your butt at the top of the
10:44
mountain so as you can imagine there is
10:46
a huge environmental gradient and all of
10:48
the species manage to
10:50
survive on those conditions so along the
10:53
coast the existence of these mountains
10:55
create environmental
10:56
variation that then allow forces species
10:59
to live on just certain places and
11:01
that's the reason why
11:02
there are so
11:04
many differences in the number of
11:05
species from side to side again mostly
11:08
related to the geomorphology causing a
11:11
huge variation on the environmental
11:13
conditions in the opposite for instance
11:15
if we focus here in south america you
11:17
get
11:17
flat areas all in in the in the interior
11:21
of the continent for instance like the
11:22
amazon the amazon you can see as far as
11:24
the i can see and obviously what happens
11:26
there is that there are general stable
11:29
and similar conditions throughout and
11:31
that allows the species to be everywhere
11:33
and that then results again
11:35
on you having the species from one side
11:38
being very similar to the locations on
11:40
other side and here then you can easily
11:41
outline biogeographical regions right
11:44
like here for instance in blue you can
11:45
see the entire amazon potentially being
11:48
defined as a biogeographical region
11:50
where most of the species are there are
11:51
commonly found everywhere
11:56
so unfortunately this issue of defining
11:58
biographical regions is not as trivial
12:00
one of the first things that you have to
12:02
deal with is the skill of which you try
12:04
to define those regions right so for
12:07
instance let me just give you an analogy
12:08
when i ask you simple things like how do
12:10
you get to be here right
12:13
there is a problem of a skill on this
12:15
question because of how do what do you
12:18
mean by here
12:19
i couldn't i could mean yeah here my
12:22
desk how do you get to be here in
12:23
honolulu how do you get to be here in
12:25
hawaii how did you get to be here in the
12:26
united states how did you get to be here
12:28
on earth so as you can see there is a
12:31
a huge variation on the scale at which
12:34
you can define a space right and that
12:36
also applies to the issue of defining
12:38
these boundaries
12:40
that are clustered different similar
12:42
places in the planet so scientists have
12:45
kind of agreed already on some
12:47
on the use of certain terms to define
12:50
this potential hierarchy on skills
12:52
the largest skills
12:55
that we can use to cluster things is
12:57
what is called realms inside realms we
13:00
have regions inside regions we have
13:01
provinces inside provinces we have
13:03
subdivisions and that again is a
13:06
hierarchy that a scientist had used to
13:07
define the the skill or the magnitude at
13:10
which these
13:11
areas are clustered together and at
13:14
times you will see these in
13:15
biogeographical regions these places
13:17
being referred and i want you to
13:19
understand what they mean and how they
13:20
are clustered okay
13:24
now that's a problem again with defining
13:26
the regions is the scale up would you
13:27
decide to create the regions the other
13:29
problem is the data that you use to
13:31
outline those boundaries so as i
13:32
explained to you earlier in another
13:34
class the the species are normally
13:37
classified into what is called a
13:38
taxonomy hierarchy right so you get a
13:40
species genomes family orders and
13:42
whatever so depending on the data that
13:44
you use you may end up with completely
13:45
different boundaries for those regions
13:47
let me just give you an example here of
13:49
two places canada and russia and let's
13:51
imagine that i want to find out if those
13:53
two places are from the same region or
13:55
not
13:56
if i use data at the genomes level
13:59
you can see that
14:00
i at the genos level i had the
14:02
genociders in russia in canada and in
14:04
russia if i look at pisa i had a genus
14:07
also in russia if i look at penis it's
14:09
also in russia so in this case at the
14:12
genos level canada and russia are
14:14
identical right they had exactly the
14:16
same type of geniuses on both countries
14:19
but now when i look at the species level
14:21
you can see that for instance in canada
14:23
the species that i had in the genus
14:24
larynx is larissina but larissina is not
14:27
found in russia
14:30
is not found in russia either pisa
14:32
mariana
14:34
is not found in russia despite the fact
14:35
that i had the genus pizza but it's a
14:37
different species embassy
14:40
banks bank siana is another species of
14:42
peanuts that i don't find in russia
14:44
so in this case i had no species in
14:46
common between canada and russia as a
14:49
result they are completely different so
14:51
as you can see here
14:53
depending on the data the taxonomic
14:55
level data that you use you may end up
14:57
getting completely different and results
15:00
that to outline those biogeographical
15:02
boundaries
15:04
the other problem that you had again you
15:06
try to identify these boundaries for
15:08
these regions is the taxa that you use
15:10
let me just give you an example and
15:12
obviously the reason being that
15:13
different species have different
15:15
capacities to especially
15:17
different capacities to disperse and
15:19
different capacities to go extinct so
15:20
that obviously can result in
15:23
all kind of different
15:25
distributions of species that mine that
15:27
are resulting in different boundaries
15:28
for those regions let me give you an
15:30
example that is very famous but it's
15:32
called the wallace line
15:34
the guadalus line is this
15:36
imaginary boundary the wallace created
15:40
in the south pacific to differentiate
15:42
apparently two different regions that
15:45
have completely different
15:47
biota rights on some one on one side of
15:50
that line you had
15:52
a lot of different species
15:54
a lot of a lot of species are very
15:56
different from the other side of that
15:58
line
15:59
so scientists have been
16:01
investigating that line for the longest
16:02
of times but what is interesting and
16:04
what i'm pointing out here from this
16:05
paper of simpson he took all of the
16:08
scientific paper that had documented
16:09
that line and what you can see is that
16:11
many papers different scientific papers
16:13
outlined that line the wireless line on
16:16
different places
16:17
right so despite the fact that again
16:19
there seems to be indeed something we
16:21
are going on in the south pacific that
16:22
differentiates these two locations the
16:24
boundaries
16:25
where that happens has been very
16:27
different among scientific papers and
16:28
the most likely reason is probably the
16:31
taxa that those people are using you can
16:33
imagine for instance if you are looking
16:35
at things like birds obviously for birds
16:38
they can move relatively easy if you are
16:41
looking for instance and mammals well
16:42
mammals are going to have a hard time
16:44
going from one island to the other one
16:46
so right there in that example you can
16:48
see
16:49
the challenges of the environment on
16:52
dispersal that then will cause different
16:54
biogeographical
16:55
boundaries for these regions
16:58
the other challenges that you will
17:00
encounter again as we try to define
17:02
biogeographical regions is the fact that
17:04
those regions are likely going to change
17:05
from time to time let me just give you a
17:07
couple examples here for instance with
17:09
climate change is one so let's imagine
17:10
that this is the distribution of a
17:12
species we come along and we start
17:14
increasing the temperature it turns out
17:16
that the suitable conditions for that
17:18
species are going to be moving places
17:20
and in resolve the species by might be
17:22
moving
17:23
so here's an example for instance of a
17:24
paper by huntley that was one of the
17:26
first ones to kind of model the
17:28
redistribution of biodiversity on earth
17:31
as a consequence of climate change and
17:33
what you can see here for instance is
17:34
that now the highest diversities in
17:36
colors you can see here the number of
17:38
species in red high diversity in blue
17:40
lower diversity
17:42
and now you have the highest diversity
17:44
in central europe but by 2070 when the
17:47
temperature of the planet started
17:48
increasing at higher latitudes start
17:50
becoming hotter what you find now is
17:52
that the highest diversity is found at
17:54
higher latitudes in europe so you can
17:56
imagine obviously that we are out
17:59
delineating about geographical region
18:01
today
18:02
that region is going to be completely
18:04
different by 2017 again mostly in this
18:07
example as a result of climate change so
18:08
the point that i want that i am making
18:10
here
18:11
is that a scientist we try to define
18:13
these biogeographical regions the
18:15
limitations of the data that critically
18:17
those biogeographical boundaries are
18:18
likely to change again in this example
18:20
as a result of climate change
18:23
another interesting thing that is
18:25
happening with climate change that i
18:26
will actually point out as well is that
18:28
in many cases not only the species are
18:29
moving up north
18:31
sorry that again is the fact that in
18:33
concern in consequence to this climate
18:35
change many species are moving and nor
18:37
obviously the species many many species
18:39
especially in the ocean as in the ocean
18:41
are restricted by higher by lower
18:43
temperatures and highlighted to how the
18:44
planets warm up now these warm
18:47
temperatures start being found at high
18:48
latitudes and one of the consequences of
18:50
this is that many species now are
18:52
expanding the geographical distribution
18:54
so here's an example for instance on the
18:56
snake planning that depending on the
18:58
temperature that you get you normally
19:01
find in a higher latitude so every time
19:03
that the winter temperature becomes
19:04
hotter you can see the animal colonizing
19:06
much higher latitudes
19:09
there is a very clever paper published
19:12
by perry a supervisor of mine bodies
19:14
warm that in which they analyze again
19:16
the extent to which species are moving
19:18
at north and they compile data from many
19:20
scientific papers and what they found is
19:22
that on average the species that they
19:24
analyze have been moving in 172
19:27
kilometers adwords between 1997
19:31
1977 and 2001. we are talking about
19:34
20-so years in which because of the
19:37
warming that we are seeing in the oceans
19:38
the species have now shifted the
19:40
distributions by nearly 170 kilometers
19:44
north
19:45
and again in this case that's gonna have
19:47
consequences on how do we set the
19:49
boundaries of these regions
19:53
i also
19:55
wanted to point out that
19:58
not only the species as a result of
20:00
climate change are moving up north in
20:02
the oceans those species are also going
20:04
deeper now again because
20:06
unfortunately because of the amount of
20:08
energy that animals require when it gets
20:10
hotter they use a lot more energy and
20:12
animals in the oceans cannot afford to
20:14
to to waste energy nor do they have any
20:16
time to find it what it has been found
20:18
is that many species of fish are
20:20
actually
20:21
migrating lower
20:23
towards deeper parts of the oceans again
20:26
as a way to keep up with the
20:28
oceans getting warmer our shallower
20:30
temperatures just for you to know
20:34
regardless
20:36
so one of the again
20:37
this issue of climate change since the
20:39
distribution of species has been
20:40
documented a lot and this is a
20:42
cool paper but actually one of the first
20:44
papers published by sean william sean
20:47
that kind of look at again what will
20:48
happen to the oceans the diversity of
20:50
the oceans once once we start changing
20:52
the temperature and what he found
20:54
was that it's going to be a huge level
20:57
of species going a stain on some places
20:59
so the species colonizing new places and
21:02
as a consequence of this the assemblages
21:04
that we see today by assembling i mean
21:06
the composition of a species that we see
21:08
today is going to be very different in
21:10
the future as a result of climate change
21:12
and that
21:13
species turnover is described on this on
21:15
this map here as you can see from the
21:17
species to nowhere what he finds is that
21:19
the highest turnover of species is going
21:21
to be found towards higher latitudes
21:23
both both north and south
21:26
obviously what is
21:28
happening here is that now the species
21:30
from the tropics are having a good time
21:33
potentially moving up nor colonizing
21:35
these things there is interesting also
21:37
some reductions in similarity in the
21:39
tropics because in the tropics the
21:41
temperatures are going to get so hot for
21:42
some species that they're going to die
21:44
there so that again could explain also
21:46
some of these similarities that you're
21:47
going to see in the tropics but all
21:49
together it's believed that
21:51
local assemblages in the gross oceans
21:53
could be changed by up to 60 by 2050.
21:56
you might not think much of it right
21:58
okay we have these species there and
21:59
they're gonna change by 60 percent but
22:01
the economic consequences of that will
22:03
be brutal you can imagine for instance
22:05
entire communities having fishing fleets
22:08
completely adapted to fish certain fish
22:10
right and now the fish have just moved
22:12
somewhere else and another fish might
22:14
come but you can just not easily change
22:15
the fishing gear to fish the new thing
22:18
and unfortunately the fish is going into
22:20
another country so it's not like you can
22:21
just go to another country and fish so
22:23
this is a species turnover in the ocean
22:26
especially when it comes down to the
22:28
fisheries is gonna have incredible
22:30
consequences again because communities
22:32
are already adapted there are
22:33
geopolitical boundaries that you cannot
22:35
cross as the species do
22:38
there are also
22:40
changes on the distribution of species
22:42
because of humans and we have explained
22:44
this several times already in this class
22:46
but here is an example for instance of
22:48
some groups of species that have
22:50
modified the geographical distributions
22:52
quite dramatically mostly the carnivora
22:54
in the in south america this is a good
22:55
example by these two guys they're in
22:57
bioscience where you can see the
22:58
original distribution of the species
23:00
being everything that is in color here
23:02
and where they are found today the most
23:04
are those places in green so you can see
23:07
many of these species we almost wipe out
23:09
from where they are where used to be and
23:10
now they are restricted to only certain
23:12
amount of certain very small patches
23:14
along the original distribution and all
23:17
of that seems highly related to the
23:19
magnitude of the interaction of these
23:21
species with humans here i can see i i'm
23:23
showing you the the actual human
23:25
presence on the on north america from
23:29
black red being high human impact and
23:32
green being in law and what you can
23:34
capture from this is how on the places
23:36
where the humans impacts are the highest
23:38
are the places where the species is
23:40
almost completely eradicated which are
23:41
these places in purple here at the base
23:44
and the places where the animals remain
23:46
are places where humans have the lowest
23:47
impact so again humanity not only
23:50
through climate change but also through
23:51
the impact again through deforestation
23:54
and and killing and we're harvesting
23:56
these animals we're also changing the
23:58
distribution of these species as a
23:59
result what we define again as a region
24:02
will change as a consequence of us also
24:04
having a huge impact on those species
24:07
another driver that is changing and
24:10
modify the boundaries of these
24:12
geographical regions are the
24:14
introduction of new species so here is a
24:16
case example of the lionfish that was
24:19
introduced early on back in 1999 there
24:22
were only a couple of records found in
24:24
in florida you can see it right there
24:26
but look at what happened to this
24:28
species in just a few years by 2000 now
24:30
it was found a higher latitudes by 2003
24:34
was now found all along the atlantic
24:36
coast of the united states and by 2009
24:39
now it was found everywhere in the
24:41
caribbean isn't that mind-blowing man so
24:43
we're talking about here just 10 years
24:46
that's right
24:47
10 years time a species was released in
24:51
in the go in the florida keys and it now
24:53
managed to be everywhere in the
24:55
caribbean so now what happened here you
24:57
are adding a new species but
24:59
unfortunately this is species at times
25:01
it's also causing the extinction of
25:02
local species so again here we have
25:04
another human driven
25:07
factor that changes the composition of
25:09
assemblages that then potentially
25:12
modifies what we define as boundaries
25:14
for those biogeographical regions today
25:17
fortunately this issue of invasive
25:20
species is brutal here in this map and
25:23
showing you the the chipping lines the
25:25
pathways of chipping lines these big
25:27
boats that are moving goods and services
25:29
from place to place is highlighted there
25:31
on those lines so you can imagine the
25:33
potential for us to introduce this new
25:36
species into new ecosystems so that
25:38
again is could could be potentially or
25:40
it is already one of the major drivers
25:43
on changes in the assemblages of a
25:45
species by introducing new species and
25:48
unfortunately there are hundreds of
25:49
examples that you can point out of
25:52
species that have already been
25:53
introduced having massive consequences
25:55
for local ecosystems for good
25:57
for good bringing you species but for
26:00
bad for bad also driving species locally
26:02
to extinction
26:04
so
26:06
just to summarize the whole thing the
26:07
reality is that there is not really a
26:09
clear code way to define these
26:10
biogeographical regions as i just showed
26:12
you there but
26:15
as a result scientists have proposed a
26:18
diversity of
26:24
diversity of methods let's say
26:27
or results that are used to delineate
26:30
the biogeographical regions of the world
26:32
so here is an example this is the
26:34
outline suggested by
26:36
ut bardi and you can see how he defined
26:39
different biogeographical regions here
26:41
is another one by the wwf they went into
26:44
deeper analysis just to analyze and to
26:46
close their the planet on different
26:48
places
26:50
and this problem unfortunately is also
26:54
present even our smaller skills this is
26:55
a paper by a friend of mine well yeah
26:58
ross robertson from the smithsonian i
26:59
was used to to to work with him there at
27:02
the smithsonian in panama and this is a
27:04
paper that he published looking at the
27:05
distribution of fish in the eastern
27:07
pacific and one of the things that you
27:09
can see here is he put together
27:12
how the scientists define the
27:14
area in different regions so this is a
27:16
paper by egma this is the paper by
27:18
bricks bosque and spalding and one of
27:20
the things that he wanted to point that
27:22
point out there is how are the local
27:24
skills depending on the type of data and
27:26
analysis and taxes that you analyze you
27:28
might end up with completely different
27:30
boundaries for those regions and you
27:32
kind of try to make the case here with
27:34
this figure in his one paper there
27:36
and again showing how
27:38
and for even for the same region as
27:41
scientists have completely different
27:43
definitions for what a region
27:46
is especially the boundaries of that
27:47
region
27:48
so let me summarize the class for today
27:51
so basically again we're talking about
27:53
geographical region which is an attempt
27:56
by a scientist to delineate areas of the
27:59
world that are similar in the
28:00
composition of species not to be
28:02
confused again with biomes
28:04
and these
28:06
biogeographical regions are difficult to
28:08
define
28:09
because of the issue of a scale what
28:10
scale you define the regions
28:12
the taxonomic rank whether you are using
28:15
species data or general data
28:18
the taxonomic group right are you using
28:20
birds insects mammals
28:23
or the fact that it's very likely that
28:26
these
28:27
regions that we outline today are going
28:28
to be changing over time as i explain
28:31
a couple examples their climate change
28:33
and direct human impacts
28:34
and as a result then it's no surprise
28:37
that whatever we described today as
28:39
about geographical region is something
28:40
that is very viable
28:43
and again it can be viable because of
28:44
the climate direct human exploitation or
28:48
at times the impatience and that's just
28:49
a summary of again how do we describe
28:53
these biogeographical regions the
28:55
challenges that we encounter every time
28:57
that we wanna define them and then
28:59
why there is not really a surprise when
29:01
different scientists propose in
29:03
different regions for different places
29:05
in the world as well
