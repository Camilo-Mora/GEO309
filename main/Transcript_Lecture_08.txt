0:03
all right so now we're going to be
0:05
moving to understanding the processes of
0:08
species richness so let me just
0:09
summarize
0:10
everything up to this moment we have
0:12
described that there are very unique
0:13
characteristics that make life possible
0:15
on this planet once those
0:17
characteristics allow for life to exist
0:20
life kind of
0:22
diversified quite dramatically
0:24
there have been moments in the history
0:26
of our planet where there have been mass
0:27
extinction events
0:29
today we are not in such a thing but
0:31
we're in our way there but along this
0:33
process of species originating and going
0:35
extinct they reach places
0:39
and normally the places where they are
0:42
where the similarity
0:43
is very high in specific region is what
0:45
is called by geographical region and
0:47
those are normally defined by boundaries
0:49
on the distribution of a species and
0:52
those boundaries where the species are
0:54
found is what is called the geographical
0:56
range and it's the overlap of those
0:58
geographical ranges that allow you then
1:00
to come home any species that are not
1:01
given place that then leaves you to the
1:03
pattern of species richness
1:05
in the last class we look at how those
1:08
patterns look like from the global scale
1:10
thinking that there could be 8.7 million
1:12
species but only 1.5 million had a name
1:14
to where are those species in the world
1:16
most of the evidence points to the fact
1:18
that most of the species are likely
1:19
found in the tropics although the
1:21
pattern is general is not universal
1:24
meaning that there are some exceptions
1:25
to that and there are still limitations
1:28
though in the data on how those global
1:29
patterns are built and we described
1:31
those limitations in the last class
1:32
today we are moving to explaining those
1:35
processes again we assume that
1:36
everything is correct what are the
1:38
processes that have been suggested to
1:39
explain why most of the species are in
1:41
certain places
1:45
so
1:45
again if we assume that everything is
1:47
correct which we know is not but we
1:49
gotta
1:50
keep moving given the data that we had
1:52
the general idea or conclusion is that
1:55
there is a generality to the panel of
1:56
special reasons
1:58
the species the parent special richness
2:01
which is for the number of species to
2:02
pick in the tropics here is an example
2:05
that we did for fish but as we leak
2:08
point out his paper that pattern of a
2:10
negative relationship between latitude
2:12
increasing and the number of species
2:14
declining is found on many taxonomic
2:17
groups that we know of and again what is
2:19
general is not universal but is
2:21
relatively well understood that that's
2:22
the way that the pattern in special
2:24
relationships looks like most of the
2:25
species being in the tropics
2:28
and lower at higher latitudes here is
2:30
the pattern in two dimensions this is a
2:34
mammals this is the diversity of mammals
2:36
and you can see that the diversity of
2:38
mammals again just like any other
2:40
attacks or moreso attacks is higher at
2:42
the
2:42
tropics and it declines towards higher
2:44
latitudes but today we're going to be
2:46
talking about the patterns
2:48
the processes to this pattern what is
2:50
driving this pattern when it goes down
2:52
to the process to explain the pattern
2:55
there is a very good paper by willie
2:57
that talk all of the individual papers
2:58
that have put on explanation and he came
3:00
out with this massive table of all the
3:03
explanations for this pattern and in
3:05
that paper
3:06
he documented that there could be up to
3:08
32 different explanations for this
3:10
pattern
3:12
so obviously the number of explanations
3:14
kind of exemplifies the diversity of
3:16
human thinking but it creates a huge
3:18
problem for really understanding why
3:20
biodiversity is the way it is
3:22
let's look at
3:24
the challenges that having so many
3:27
hypotheses creates the first challenge
3:29
is this issue of multiculinarity as i
3:31
point out to you earlier
3:32
multicollinearity is basically when you
3:34
have two predictors that for some reason
3:36
are related to each other like for
3:38
instance it could be precipitation and
3:41
moisture
3:42
but then you had a dependent bible could
3:44
be a specie richness when you try to
3:46
explain how much variance predictor one
3:48
explains of that
3:50
independent variable you find that
3:52
predictor one is gonna explain some
3:53
variance that has to be explained also
3:56
by predictor two given the fact that
3:57
predictor one and predictor to relate to
3:59
each other this area of overlap
4:02
when the variance of one predictor can
4:04
also be explained by another predictor
4:05
given that those two predictors are
4:06
related is what is called
4:07
multicollinearity
4:10
now
4:11
how significant is multicollinearity
4:13
this is a paper that we published back
4:14
in the day where we tried to identify
4:16
the significance of this issue of
4:18
multiculinarity here we had
4:20
different hypotheses that would for
4:22
instance be used to explain the
4:24
diversity of fish in the oceans we had
4:26
temperatures salinity variability and
4:28
temperature productivity again these are
4:30
biological they relate to environment
4:32
and the reasoning there is that
4:33
environment is an important factor
4:34
determining how many species get to be
4:36
on a given place we also have
4:38
physiographic factors like the number of
4:40
islands and the coastline length we have
4:42
biogenic factors like the amount of
4:44
coral reefs that provides strata for
4:46
fish we had anthropogenic factors as
4:48
well thinking that maybe humans kind of
4:50
increase or decrease the number of
4:51
richness and there are other patterns
4:53
and new models so back here
4:55
we try to to provide a set of
4:57
explanations that have been proposed for
5:00
the panel of special reasons and we
5:02
tested these explanations on the fishes
5:04
of the eastern pacific because we had a
5:06
very good database very complete ross
5:07
robertson he's not young anymore but
5:10
throughout his life what he did he
5:12
traveled all of the insta-pacific
5:13
counting how many species are there so
5:15
it's one of the one of those regions in
5:16
the world that thanks to him we know
5:19
very well how many species are on
5:21
different places so we make use of that
5:22
beautiful database that he put together
5:24
to test all of these hypotheses so what
5:26
we plan what we found was this when you
5:28
look at the effect of temperature
5:30
temperature explains 81 of the variants
5:33
on a special region of fish a
5:35
variability explains 21 the number of
5:37
islands explains four percent the area
5:39
of coral reefs explain 15 percent the
5:41
area of coastal development 25 percent
5:44
the wrap-up for effect 64 percent the
5:46
middle of a fed 90
5:48
if you were to add up all of the
5:49
variance that is explained by these
5:51
variables you find that combined they
5:53
explain 359 percent of the variance but
5:56
you only have 100 of the variance that
5:58
you can realistically explain that then
6:00
tells you the degree of overestimation
6:03
that is being caused by the
6:05
multicollinearity between these bibles
6:07
and again
6:10
consequence of this then is that we can
6:12
just not really tell
6:14
who am on all of these bibles are really
6:16
the ones that are driving the species
6:18
racism and all of that again is because
6:20
there is a huge diversity of bibles that
6:22
unfortunately are multicollinear to each
6:23
other
6:25
now even in cases where we seem to know
6:29
only a unique variable
6:30
related to a species richness how that
6:33
bible influences
6:35
the pattern is something that is still
6:37
unclear that's what is called the
6:38
mechanism let me just give you an
6:39
example here here there is a diversity
6:42
of diversity of everything that is in
6:45
the ocean in the indian and pacific
6:46
ocean one of the things that you find
6:48
in these two oceans is that there is an
6:50
incredible diversity of species in this
6:52
region called the ipr in the pacific
6:55
region and
6:57
the question is okay we already know
6:59
that there is a high diversity of
7:00
species there why so there are three
7:02
contrasting hypotheses to explain this
7:05
one is what is called the center of
7:06
origination when you look at the number
7:08
of islands on this place there are
7:10
thousands of islands located here so
7:12
these islands are actually places where
7:14
species can
7:15
originate there because they get to be
7:17
isolated so the idea of the origination
7:20
is that the reason why you see gradients
7:22
of species reactions is because a lot of
7:23
species originate there and they move
7:25
towards higher towards towards in more
7:28
remote places and then that creates a
7:29
gradient from a lot of species here
7:31
towards fewer species on the very ferry
7:35
the other mechanism is what is called
7:37
the center of overlap this idea suggests
7:39
that there are very clear
7:40
biogeographical regions on all of these
7:42
two oceans and it's the overlap of those
7:45
regions in that region of the ipr that
7:47
leads to a lot of species
7:50
being found on this region it's nothing
7:51
special about the region or the fact
7:53
that that's the place where most of the
7:55
biodiversity of other regions overlap
7:57
and that will then lead you to having a
7:59
lot of species there
8:00
the mechanism
8:03
again is that again i'm just
8:05
simplifying this case origination is
8:07
happening everywhere and it's just the
8:08
the movement of species towards that
8:10
place in the ipr that leads to having a
8:13
lot of species in the ipr
8:14
the other idea is what is called the
8:16
center of accumulation this idea
8:18
suggests that these red points here
8:20
indicate areas where species are
8:22
originating and they are originating all
8:24
around the indian and pacific ocean but
8:26
when you look at the currents of this
8:28
region you find that in this region the
8:31
in the pacific side the currents
8:32
normally flow towards the ipr and in the
8:35
indian ocean the currents normally flow
8:37
towards the ipr as well so it's
8:39
basically this convergence of currents
8:43
in in this region that then leads to the
8:45
species
8:46
that were originated on those places
8:48
converging in the
8:50
indo-pacific and this is what is called
8:51
the center of accumulation so here is an
8:54
example where you have three contrasting
8:56
mechanisms to explain a pattern of why
8:58
there are so many species in the ipr
9:02
let me give you another example
9:04
i want you to think about this
9:05
relationship
9:06
relationship here between biodiversity
9:08
and the number of people i don't want to
9:10
show you this just yet i want you to
9:12
pass this video and think about how this
9:14
correlation is we have already talked
9:15
about
9:17
people normally being no good for the
9:18
biodiversity with that being said then
9:20
how would you expect to be the
9:22
correlation between the number of
9:23
species and the number of people pause
9:25
this video and let's get back at the end
9:27
of your break
9:29
so i hope that you will have say given
9:31
that that we know that people is not
9:33
good for biodiversity that you willing
9:36
you will find that the biodiversity
9:39
declines as the number of people
9:40
increases i hope that you guys kind of
9:42
reasoning there that if you didn't know
9:45
the the data beforehand and again
9:48
because it makes sense right that it has
9:50
negative impacts on biodiversity as we
9:52
increase the number of people
9:53
biodiversity declines
9:56
again just for you to to realize that in
9:58
a science everything is to be tested and
10:00
proof
10:01
when scientists went and tested the
10:02
hypotheses what they found was that it
10:04
was kind of the opposite as you increase
10:07
the number of people to increase the
10:08
number of species isn't that remarkable
10:10
this is a paper that was published by
10:12
banford and another one by araujo they
10:14
analyzed this pattern on the
10:16
relationship between richness and
10:18
biodiversity in europe and in africa and
10:20
they analyze it for plants birds mammals
10:22
snakes and amphibians and everywhere
10:24
they look there was a positive
10:25
relationship here so the more people
10:28
there is the more species they are again
10:30
that was kind of contrasting given what
10:32
we thought humans do to people so that
10:34
obviously then creates an interesting
10:36
question which is why
10:38
why we know that people is negative have
10:41
mostly negative effects on biodiversity
10:43
why is it that there are more species
10:44
where there are more people
10:46
so there are multiple explanations for
10:48
this and there is a professor called
10:50
kevin gaston from the uk i had a couple
10:53
papers that have published within super
10:54
nice guy to work with and he's like like
10:57
a like a like a
10:59
rock star in science especially on
11:01
biogeography he has a very nice paper
11:03
when he analyzed the likely explanations
11:05
for this pattern
11:08
the first one is the fact that he
11:10
speculates that maybe people and
11:13
richness respond the same
11:15
to to the environment just like at some
11:17
kind some case of multicollinearity
11:19
where species regions for instance
11:21
relate positively with temperature and
11:23
so are we so that that further the
11:26
species richness and us correlate with
11:27
the environment then
11:29
forces to be correlated with racism but
11:31
it's not that we are impacting racism so
11:33
that's one of the hypotheses
11:36
the other explanation that is proposed
11:38
has been proposed is that by us
11:41
introducing new species and species that
11:44
are there being impacted and having a
11:46
hard time to go esteem
11:48
then what that does is that we actually
11:49
work as a way to increase the number of
11:51
species so that basically humans are
11:53
creating a net gain of a species in
11:55
certain places
11:58
the other hypothesis is what is called
12:00
the climate stability hypothesis
12:02
basically what suggests here is that
12:04
this similarity that we see today is a
12:06
legacy of plasma glaciation so back in
12:08
the day when there were placiations
12:10
obviously everything from species to
12:12
humans were restricted mostly to a few
12:14
places of pockets where the number of
12:17
species and people were very high
12:19
as the glaciation went away the the
12:22
diversity of species and people start
12:24
spraying from those places and that then
12:26
forces the number of species to
12:28
correlate with people again not know
12:30
that we pan biodiversity but rather than
12:32
the two of us come from the same places
12:36
the final explanation is what is called
12:38
the disturbance meat disturbance
12:40
hypothesis so the idea here is that when
12:43
humans by us having negative impact on
12:45
biodiversity what we can do is to knock
12:47
out a species that become dominant and
12:51
by us knocking down species that become
12:53
nominated we allow a species that are
12:55
weak to prosper in those places so the
12:58
idea here is that when we humans go and
13:00
we start disturbing disturbing
13:01
ecosystems we allow some kind of
13:03
coexistence between species that be that
13:05
would be very competitive and in the
13:07
species where they're they're to be left
13:09
alone the species that is dominant will
13:11
go esteem and the species that is sorry
13:12
will be the species that is dominant
13:14
will go to to dominate and the one that
13:16
is weak will go to extinct but by us
13:18
being on those places we kind of knock
13:20
out the species are dominant allowing
13:21
those two species to coexist so those
13:23
are the four different hypotheses that
13:26
have been suggested to explain this
13:27
correlation and again i'm using this as
13:29
evidence to suggest that what we might
13:31
find at times very strong relationships
13:34
between the pattern and a variable that
13:36
doesn't mean that we know very well how
13:39
is it that the variable leads to that
13:41
pattern
13:42
here is another example again where the
13:44
mechanism is not very well known which
13:46
is the relationship between
13:48
the number of species and temperature
13:50
obviously
13:51
we get certain amount of energy the
13:54
blast or planet and that energy is going
13:55
to be more abundant in tropical areas
13:57
and that amount of energy is going to be
13:59
fewer at the north and south pole and
14:01
the distribution of energy on our planet
14:04
them is speculated to influence not only
14:06
temperature but then as a result the
14:08
number of species
14:10
and indeed many papers had documented
14:13
this relationship this is a paper by my
14:15
friend titansaur from the house
14:17
university in this paper he correlated
14:20
the number of species in the planet
14:21
against temperature in the oceans and
14:23
you can see that there is always a
14:24
positive correlation no matter how you
14:26
cut the data right so
14:29
almost always
14:30
every time that there is an increase in
14:31
temperature places that are hotter
14:33
normally have more species so that's
14:36
again a pattern that is highly related
14:39
to a variable but then what is the
14:40
mechanism
14:42
there is a paper by corey in ecology
14:44
letters when he goes through houses that
14:46
this temperature can make
14:48
species be more abundant
14:51
right
14:51
abundant i mean in terms of number of
14:53
species there so he suggested three
14:56
explanations for it the first one is
14:58
what is called the more individual
15:00
hypothesis so temperature by it being
15:03
related to a larger amount of energy
15:05
that comes directly from the sun then
15:06
allows to have more individuals and
15:08
obviously they are more individual there
15:09
could be potentially more chances for
15:11
reproduction that then lead to having
15:13
you more species
15:16
the other one is what is called the
15:17
physiological tolerance hypothesis this
15:19
hypothesis suggests that what happens is
15:21
that
15:23
generating the evolutionary capacity to
15:25
live on cold places is very hard while
15:28
it's relatively easy for most species to
15:29
be able to tolerate warm temperatures
15:32
surviving colder temperatures is a
15:34
physiological adaptation that is very
15:36
rare so this the similarity in the
15:38
capacities of a species to cope with
15:40
temperature
15:41
allows a lot of species to be found in
15:43
the tropics where most species can
15:44
survive and very few species can survive
15:47
at high latitudes again issues because
15:49
they lack the capacity the physiological
15:51
capacity to tolerate those colder
15:53
temperatures that's against what is
15:54
called the physiological tolerance
15:56
hypothesis which is that most of the
15:59
species canceled by warm but not cold
16:01
conditions
16:03
the other explanation for the
16:05
relationship between richness and
16:07
temperature is what is called the
16:08
speciation rate hypothesis and what it
16:10
suggests here is that when you increase
16:13
temperature there is normally a
16:16
faster evolutionary rate for some reason
16:18
a lot of species like to have sex when
16:20
it gets hot and that increases the
16:22
chances of introducing mutations that
16:24
then turn into more species and that has
16:26
been tested on multiple
16:29
species and like insects mostly where
16:31
you can just crack up the temperature a
16:33
little bit and see how those species
16:35
reproduce you they have found the same
16:37
similar things in bacteria as well again
16:39
case examples where any time that you
16:41
increase in the temperature you increase
16:44
reproduction and as a result you
16:45
increase the chances of introducing
16:46
mutations that will then turn into
16:48
different species and again here is
16:50
another example where there is a very
16:52
clear relationship between apparent
16:54
which is the number the number of
16:55
species available which is temperature
16:58
but we have very unclear about how you
17:00
see the temperature causes the richness
17:05
so that finishes the lecture today the
17:07
class
17:08
on as it relates to patterns and
17:11
processes i want to finish up this class
17:13
though by talking about the significance
17:15
of us it better identifying this pattern
17:17
of special richness for the purpose of
17:19
conservation so there are at least two
17:21
or three different uh important aspects
17:24
of us knowing these patterns of species
17:26
risk the first one is that it allows you
17:28
to identify areas that need to be
17:30
protected those those are what are
17:31
called hot spots hotspots are places in
17:34
the world
17:35
that have the high diversity of species
17:38
right and those it turns out that those
17:40
places are not very abundant and then
17:42
the idea here is that you can use the
17:44
pattern of species richness to then
17:46
outline the boundaries of those hot
17:48
spots for them to be protected there are
17:50
two efforts that have been done to do
17:52
this one is the paper by myers that
17:54
analyzed biodiversity hospitals on land
17:57
and you can see them here in red those
17:59
are the places with the highest
18:00
diversity of species anywhere in the
18:02
world and these are the species owned in
18:05
the ocean this is a paper by calvin
18:06
roberts and he outlined the biodiversity
18:09
hotspots in the oceans so again that's
18:12
one attribute that is very important
18:14
about us knowing the parents in species
18:16
regions better which is to identify
18:18
these boundaries where the species are
18:20
found
18:22
the other important attributes of a
18:23
species richness for conservation is
18:25
that they allow us to identify what are
18:27
the risks for biodiversity so here's an
18:29
example for instance of a paper by
18:32
cincota
18:34
in which he analyzed
18:35
the hospitals of biodiversity against
18:37
the number of people and he correlated
18:39
those two things and what he
18:41
demonstrated here is that most of the
18:43
people in the world are actually living
18:45
on those hot spots again most likely
18:47
because of their fact that biodiversity
18:49
relates with the number of people as a
18:51
result where there is the most diversity
18:53
in the world is where you have the most
18:54
people and he documented that on this
18:56
figure here
18:57
so in this figure are every one of the
19:00
25 hotspots in the world that have been
19:03
identified before by myers again those
19:05
are the places with the highest
19:06
diversity of species in the world those
19:08
are the places that you think need to be
19:10
protected need to be removed from any
19:11
human stressor but when you look at the
19:13
number of people on those hotspots what
19:15
you find
19:16
is that
19:17
on average the global average density of
19:20
people is 42 but inside those hotspots
19:22
the average density of people is 73
19:24
people so you have almost twice the
19:26
number of people living on those hot
19:28
spots so you can imagine if we know that
19:30
humans have different consequences are
19:31
normally negative to the species that
19:34
live on those places but we are talking
19:36
based on these analysis of us knowing
19:37
where the species are is that we can
19:39
show that the human impulse could be
19:41
potentially double
19:43
the impacts on those places where the
19:45
highest diversity and again that's one
19:46
of the important attributes of us better
19:48
knowing these patterns of species
19:50
richness here's another example that was
19:53
done by director on his paper in nature
19:55
where he analyzed the same deal but on
19:57
the oceans and here you can see the
19:59
diversity of all taxa in the world and
20:02
in black are those polygons that had the
20:04
highest diversity of species he
20:06
correlated that against the human
20:08
footprint in the ocean which is again a
20:09
cumulative index of the magnitude of
20:12
different impacts that happen on every
20:14
single pixel in the world and what he
20:16
managed to show on this paper is that
20:18
almost all of the pixels in the world
20:21
are under areas that have high human
20:24
impacts and again it's another
20:26
interesting
20:28
benefit of us but in knowing these
20:30
better these patterns of a special
20:31
reason which is not only to know what
20:33
areas need to be protected by what areas
20:35
are at most risk of human of humans let
20:38
me summarize the two lectures as they
20:40
relate to species richness
20:42
so we don't know really how many species
20:44
are there in the world but what we know
20:46
is that they are about 1.5 million
20:48
species that have a name and there could
20:49
be easily up to 8.7 million species
20:52
where are those species in the world
20:54
well the reality is that we don't know
20:56
very well we have problems on the way
20:58
the data is standardized some patterns
21:00
can be overestimated depending on where
21:02
we use geographical ranges or there
21:05
could be a lack of considerable data to
21:07
build patterns based on census data and
21:10
that unfortunately
21:12
leads to a
21:14
patterns that are weak and
21:17
not only the parents are not reliable
21:19
100
21:20
what are the processes to those parents
21:22
is also something that we know we don't
21:24
know very well
21:26
and again as i explained to you there
21:27
could be multiple statistical issues as
21:30
they relate to multicollinearity and the
21:31
fact that we had tons of bibles that
21:33
would explain these patterns
21:35
and again not only though we don't know
21:37
very well the parents the processes are
21:39
not very well known and unfortunately
21:41
that's very sad because unfortunately
21:43
this information about the patterns and
21:46
processes of biodiversity are
21:47
fundamental if we want to better protect
21:49
those species and that finishes the
21:51
class for today for this episode see you
21:53
guys in the next chapter
