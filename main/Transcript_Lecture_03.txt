Intro
0:06
so today we are going to be looking at
0:08
taxonomy systematics and philogenics
0:11
instead of describing what the problem
0:14
is here when you look at the diversity
0:15
of life on the planet it turns out that
0:17
there are tons of species that we share
0:19
the planet with and obviously one of the
0:21
things that we have to do is to figure
0:23
out a way to put them together organize
0:24
them right
0:26
and basically what we need is a
0:27
classification system basically we need
0:29
to take all of these species that we
0:31
share the planet with and put it in a
0:33
organizing in a way that we can easily
0:35
understand them that's what it's called
0:36
a classification system let me just give
Classification system
0:39
you an example to contextualize the
0:40
problem that we are dealing with imagine
0:42
that you are an alien species and you
0:44
just go into this planet and you find
0:46
this interview of this organism
0:48
and obviously the first thing that you
0:49
have to do is to give it a name you need
0:51
to name it if you are the first one to
0:53
find it actually you get to name it and
0:54
let's say that i call this guy the spoon
0:57
right the second problem that you have
0:58
to encounter is how do i organize this
1:01
guy in relationship to similar guys that
1:03
i find in this planet well it turns out
1:05
that we need to have something a
1:07
classification a way to classify this
1:09
individual it turns out that there is a
1:10
place called the kitchen and in that
1:12
inside the kitchen there is something
1:13
called a cabinet and inside that cabinet
1:15
there is something called a cutler
1:17
clothing organizer and it turns out that
1:19
in that place there are individuals that
1:22
are very similar to my spoon
1:24
so as you can imagine now if i get here
1:27
and i'm looking for a spoon i know
1:29
exactly where to look to go and look for
1:31
my spoon and that's the significance
1:33
here of us having a classification
1:35
system and of course having a name so
1:37
basically
1:39
when we try to classify all these
1:40
species in the planet you have two
1:42
problems at hand one is naming
1:44
and the other one is classification
1:48
in biogeography or generally sciences
1:50
the actual term that deals with the
1:53
naming and classification of a species
1:55
is called taxonomy again when you take
1:57
the diversity of species on the planet
1:59
and we deal with the
2:00
we and we deal with this problem of
2:02
trying to get in a name and organizing
2:04
in a classification system the name or
2:05
the study of that is called taxonomy
2:07
again taxonomy is the story of naming
2:09
and classifying biological organisms
2:13
this idea of classifying
2:16
a species is not new and in fact the
2:18
first record of us ever trying to
2:20
classify the species came from this guy
2:22
called aristotles that came out with
2:24
what is called the aristotelian system
2:26
it was again 300 years before christ 400
2:30
years before christ and basically again
2:32
again this this guy this one guy was the
2:34
first one to try to classify organisms
2:37
the naming system that he used was
2:39
basically the description of the parts
2:41
of the species so for instance uh uh
2:45
something like me he will say
2:47
that species has hair has a skin had
2:50
teeth
2:51
wax so that's what he used to to name
2:54
the species there was not an eight
2:55
percent but rather a description of how
2:57
the individual was used to look like and
3:00
as for the grouping or classification
3:01
system he has two groups everything in
3:04
life he organized between plants
3:06
and animals and within plants he had two
3:08
groups that were small large and medium
3:11
and for animals he had soup groups that
3:14
were land water and air so again imagine
3:17
you trying to to to have all these
3:20
species in the planet giving them very
3:22
complex names and trying to classify
3:24
them into either plants or animals and
3:26
within plants small large or or large
3:28
small large or
3:30
small
3:31
or medium sorry
3:33
so
3:34
obviously that system created by
3:36
aristotle's was not very good because
3:38
not all of the species could be easily
3:40
put into that classification system
3:42
let's just look at an example here again
3:45
if you look at animals the general group
3:47
was animals so groups land water and air
3:50
but if you take an example like the frog
3:52
for instance well it turns out that the
3:53
frog when they are adults they live on
3:55
land but when they are young they live
3:57
in water so in this case of this animal
4:01
it was very hard to to classify this
4:03
species on the taxonomic system that was
4:06
introduced by aristotle's
4:08
so
4:10
actually 2 000 years later back in 1700
4:14
this guy came along called carolius
4:18
that came out with a new system called
4:20
the linear classification system we use
4:22
a version of this system even today he's
4:25
defined as the fire of taxonomy
4:28
well let's see what he came up with as
4:31
it comes down to the naming he decided
4:32
to use what is called a binomial naming
4:34
system basically every species is going
4:37
to have a name
4:39
that is called the genus and a specific
4:41
name basically like every person has a
4:43
name and a last name he came up with a
4:45
similar system again he used genus and a
4:48
specific name let's look at an example
4:50
here like homo sapiens in the case of
4:52
homo sapiens
4:53
omo
4:54
is genus and sapiens is the specific
4:57
name the specific name is also at times
4:59
called a specific
5:00
appetite
5:03
what about the grouping the way that he
5:05
classified the species he came up with
5:07
something called the taxonomy hierarchy
5:09
and basically what he did he took a
5:12
species that were similar to each other
5:14
based on their attributes
5:16
that you could see and came up with this
5:18
a
5:19
again system called the taxonomy
5:20
hierarchy in which you had the base a
5:22
species
5:24
species are grouped within genocides
5:26
genos is a group within families
5:28
families within orders ordered in class
5:30
class within phylum and basically he
5:32
came out with this
5:34
hierarchy in which individuals are
5:36
clustered depending on how similar they
5:38
are among them
5:41
here's an example for instance for the
5:43
for the grizzly bear bear how is it
5:44
classified according to the linear
5:46
system so again at the base here you
5:48
have a species the name of the species
5:50
is ursus are twos ursus will be the
5:53
genus arctus will be the a specific name
5:56
that is clustered within genus and it
5:58
turns out that their species shares very
6:00
similar characteristics with the polar
6:02
bear
6:03
and that genus is clustered within the
6:05
family or she died that is also
6:08
a part of the panda bear
6:10
sharing against similar characteristics
6:12
and you can see how
6:14
from the bottom
6:15
of a species all the way up to the main
6:17
you start clustering species depending
6:19
on how similar they are and this is
6:21
again the taxonomy hierarchy that
6:22
lineals came up with
convergent evolution
6:25
now unfortunately the
6:27
the system that was introduced by
6:28
linneos was not perfect let's look at an
6:31
example here we had a bird and a bat you
6:34
can see that there are very similar
6:36
attributes to these species like they
6:38
have wings and they have a the capacity
6:40
to fly so again those are attributes
6:42
that you can measure and given the
6:44
system that lineals use of
6:46
grouping individuals by the similarity
6:48
of their attributes you could
6:49
potentially say that these two species
6:51
then belong to the same group so again
6:53
this this idea what is called convergent
6:55
evolution in which you have the species
6:57
that are in completely different
6:58
pathways of evolution having similar
7:01
attributes
7:02
that had nothing to do with them but
7:04
unfortunately for the linear system it
7:06
was very difficult to to separate these
7:08
things because nails was a basically
7:12
grouping species depending on how
7:13
similar those attributes were and in
7:15
this case example these two species
7:17
belong to completely different branches
7:18
of evolution but they are very similar
7:20
so
7:21
that's the reason why the lineal system
7:23
was not quite perfect
cladistic classification
7:25
then it came out this guy came about
7:28
charles darwin and charles darwin came
7:31
out and introduced something that is
7:32
pretty simple but it has been
7:33
revolutionary for the way that we see
7:35
evolution a life in the planet and it's
7:38
the idea that all species of light had a
7:40
descendant that comes from a common
7:42
ancestor imagine that this guy made it
7:44
to the history books
7:45
just by making that simple discovery
7:47
that all of the species that we see
7:49
today come from a common ancestor the
7:52
significance of this
7:54
for the classification system is that it
7:56
allows to introduce a whole new way to
7:58
classify
7:59
the
8:00
the species that we share the planet
8:01
with and that's what is called the
8:03
cladistic classification system
8:05
again let me just
8:07
simplify how the classification system
8:09
works as for the naming they are using
8:11
exactly the same name naming style that
8:13
was used by linneos white to reinvent
8:15
something that works very well and it's
8:17
pretty nice and simple which is a
8:18
species having a name and a last name so
8:20
to speak
8:21
but for the grouping
8:23
rather than using a taxonomic hierarchy
8:26
in which species are grouped by their
8:28
general attributes in this
8:30
classification system those groupings
8:33
are based on the philogenic
8:34
phyllogenetic relationship among species
8:37
how closely in the evolution of life
8:39
those species are and that then is used
8:42
as a way to classify a
8:46
the species
8:48
this classification system obviously was
8:50
a huge improvement to the system that
8:52
was
8:53
introduced by linneos originally again
8:55
you look at this example of the birds
8:57
with the bats and you rather use the
9:00
phylogeny again how the species are
9:02
related over time you find that using
9:05
the cladistic system the birds are in a
9:07
completely different branch of evolution
9:09
that they than the models so
9:12
again that that was a huge improvement
9:14
in the way that we separate species in
9:16
this classification system that we use
9:18
today
systematics
9:20
now
9:21
the emergence of of evolution of us
9:24
knowing evolution are using that as a
9:26
way to classify species led to what is
9:28
called systematics but systematics is
9:30
basically the field of story about the
9:32
classification of organisms by based on
9:34
the revolution this idea again that we
9:36
can classify a species in using this
9:38
taxonomic hierarchy by looking at the
9:41
evolution of those species
9:43
basically is the
9:45
the system introduced by lineals and
9:47
arguing coming together on a single
9:49
classification system a huge improvement
9:51
so here it is this is the taxonomy
9:53
hierarchy introduced by lynn nels
9:56
and here we have the philogenetic
10:00
map of life in the planet that was
10:01
introduced by charles darwin you can put
10:03
those two things together and now we
10:05
have a very neat way to organize the
10:08
species that we share the planet with
10:10
something that again allows to create
10:12
groups of species that we can easily
10:16
map along this map of how they evolve
10:21
so i'm going to introduce a few terms
10:24
that i have probably spoke about that
10:25
probably i should define the first one
10:26
is phylogeny phylogeny is basically the
10:29
history of evolution of a species or
10:32
the revolutionary relationships so here
10:34
is an example of a phylogeny again how
10:37
the species are related to each other
10:41
and phylogenetics is the study of
10:43
phylogenys basically phylogenetics is
10:45
the story of reconstruction of past
10:47
evolutionary history of a species or
10:49
taxa again philogenetics is a field of
10:52
study that studies phylogenys
10:55
so how are these phylogenys done you
10:58
know like how is that you managed to
11:00
create this is these trees
11:02
that that lead to the philosophies how
11:04
are they created well there are
11:06
different ways to do that one is what is
11:08
called chair ancestral or chair their
11:10
life character characters
11:13
when when you had a species when you had
11:15
when you said the notion that was
11:17
introduced by darwin that all of the
11:19
species come from a common ancestor one
11:20
of the things that you will find is that
11:22
there are characters left on the species
11:24
from the ancestral
11:27
species where they come from that's what
11:28
is called chair ancestral characters
11:30
again are characters that you see on
11:33
individuals that are shared with the
11:35
ancestor and then you have obviously
11:37
another set of characters which are
11:39
characters that are now new and specific
11:41
to that species and that's what is
11:42
called share derived characters okay let
11:45
me just give you an example this is for
11:47
instance the phylogeny of most
11:49
vertebrates again
11:51
and let's now look at the mammals right
11:53
there so when you look at the mammals it
11:55
turns out that one attribute that they
11:57
have is this hair
11:59
when you look at hair all of the mammals
12:01
have hair but no other vertebrate has
12:04
hair so in this specific case of the
12:06
mammals hair then becomes a chair
12:09
derived character again it's a character
12:11
that is unique to that clay that is not
12:14
shared with ancestral
12:16
species
12:18
let's look at another character which is
12:20
the backbones which i highlight here for
12:22
this species now when you look at the
12:24
back when you look at the backbone
12:25
that's an attribute that is found in
12:27
many other species
12:29
in common to the mammals so in this case
12:32
this backbone is an ancestral
12:34
characteristic of leopards right because
12:37
again it's ancestral in the sense that
12:39
the backbone is also shared by many
12:41
other species on on the phylogeny of
12:44
vertebrates
12:45
so again the difference here between
12:48
derived characters are characters that
12:49
are new to to the species to the clay
12:52
and ancestral characters are those
12:54
characters that are found on the
12:55
essential on the ancestral species so
12:58
with that in mind then
13:00
how do we build phylogenys using those
13:03
type of characters especially the
13:04
characters that are derived so here is
13:06
an example here again you have the
13:08
philology of the vertebrates here you
13:10
have the different tags and here you
13:11
have the different attributes so
13:12
basically what you do is you see the
13:15
presence of these characters along the
13:17
different taxes and given this whether
13:20
the character is present or not then you
13:22
can
13:23
go back and reconstruct the relationship
13:26
on them
13:27
and again this is one way to create this
13:30
philogenics based on the life characters
13:32
basically by looking at the present or
13:35
presence or accents of these kind of
13:37
absence of these characters on several
13:39
taxes
13:41
another way to build
13:42
philogenes is by using molecules things
13:45
like proteins and dna turns out that
13:48
these molecules make part of every
13:50
single organism in life and basically
13:52
what we can do is to sequence
13:54
the the molecules that make those
13:57
things like proteins and dna and by
13:59
looking at the similarities between
14:01
these proteins or dna among different
14:04
species then we can build these
14:08
philogenetic trees again how similar are
14:10
these proteins or dna among different
14:12
species and it allows to then create
14:14
phylogenys that are based on molecules
14:19
now with the possibility of us now
14:21
reconstructing how species are related
14:23
to each other via philogenics which
14:26
which is a a tool that is used in
14:29
philogenetics now we can put all of
14:31
these species together in what is called
14:32
the tree of life and it's a beautiful
14:35
thing no joke when you start seeing all
14:37
of these species sometimes sharing these
14:39
ancestral or these derived
14:40
characteristics and how that allows you
14:42
to then see how all these species in the
14:44
planet are related and here is a general
14:46
reconstruction of all of the species
14:48
that we share the planet with we start
14:50
with three domains of life we have
14:52
archaea eukaryota and bacteria the
14:55
bacteria and
14:56
the archaea and bacteria are pretty much
14:58
the same thing are organisms that had no
15:01
nucleus and the main difference between
15:02
bacteria and archaea is that
15:04
they had different molecules on on their
15:09
cell walls
15:11
the eukaryota in turn in turn is divided
15:14
in five different kingdoms depending on
15:16
the classification system including
15:18
plants animals fungi and proteins if we
15:20
go down the animal pathway you will see
15:23
that some animals are defined between
15:25
animals nidarians or bilat bilateral
15:28
bilateral are species that if you take
15:31
their body and cut in half one half is
15:34
going to be another copy of the other
15:35
one so you take myself you come in half
15:37
you will see that this side is very
15:38
similar to that science that's why it's
15:40
called bilaterial and you can
15:42
look at many species that share that
15:44
attribute you take a fish cutting hub
15:46
you will see that one size exactly to
15:47
the other one turns out that there is a
15:50
a branch of evolution and then within
15:52
that branch of species are bellator and
15:54
you get crustaceans are troposphere to
15:56
raise moles in vertebrates then you get
15:59
in
16:00
the
16:01
mammals reptilians turtles
16:03
and you name it and again thanks to
16:05
these phylogenys that we can build based
16:08
on these characters our ceremony species
16:10
or based on our understanding of the
16:12
molecules that make those individuals
16:14
now we can reconstruct these trees all
16:17
life
16:19
now
16:21
several times through this class i have
16:22
talked about this concept of a species
16:24
but what is a species that's another
16:26
thing that has turned out to be quite
16:27
controversial in science and in fact
16:29
there are 26 different ways to to
16:32
describe a species so what is the con
16:34
there are actually 26
16:36
26 different concepts of what a species
16:38
is
16:39
the most common concept that is affected
16:41
the most today is what is called the
16:43
biological species concept
16:45
the biological species concept basically
16:48
suggests that a species is defined as
16:49
groups of groups of organisms that can
16:52
successfully interpret and produce
16:54
fertile offspring basically again
16:57
individuals that can reproduce with each
16:59
other and having offspring that can
17:01
survive by be viable that is what is
17:03
defined uh a species and that term
17:07
generally speaking is what is called the
17:08
biological species concept
Biological Species
17:10
now unfortunately there are problems
17:13
with that concept right one of the
17:15
obvious problems is a sexual
17:17
reproduction now all the species in the
17:18
planet are reproduced by by
17:20
sexual mechanisms some of them reproduce
17:22
completely as sexual meaning that you
17:24
can take an individual spirit in two and
17:26
then you get
17:28
to to also the same species
17:30
and the example of that is bacteria and
17:33
the viruses basically these species live
17:35
life with no sex
17:37
but many other species the ones that are
17:39
included within the biological
17:40
definition concept of species those are
17:43
those species
17:44
reproduce via sex these ones multiply
17:47
reproduce without having sex they
17:49
basically split themselves in halves and
17:51
that's how they manage to reproduce
17:54
the other problem of the biological
17:56
concept is hybridization have
17:58
realization is basically when different
18:00
species come together and produce
18:02
offspring that myomino will be viable
18:04
over a few generations an example is a
18:07
zebra and a donkey they go out in a date
18:11
and the result of that day is what is
18:13
called asanki right so here is an
18:15
example again in which two very
18:17
different species still manage to
18:20
interpret to produce offspring so that
18:22
becomes complicated
18:24
in the terms on on the
18:27
use of the biological concept for this
18:29
species because they clearly reproduce
18:31
and produce offspring
18:34
another limitation of the biological
18:35
concept of species is this idea of the
18:38
horizontal gene transfer so basically
18:40
what happens here is that there are many
18:43
species especially in bacteria and
18:45
archaea
18:46
that
18:47
they have been evolving over branches of
18:49
evolution over many different times and
18:51
they have been separated for millions of
18:52
years so how they come together and they
18:55
reproduce and that reproduction still
18:56
leads to viable
18:58
species and that's what it's called
18:59
horizontally and transfer that is so
19:01
crazy in bacteria and archaea for them
19:04
to do this this is like having a whale
19:07
and an insect which are two groups of
19:10
animals that have wolves in completely
19:12
different pathways
19:13
putting them together and having a well
19:15
and an insect reproducing or producing
19:17
another another species so that is
19:20
exactly what is happening here with the
19:21
bacteria in archaea having lineages that
19:24
have been separated for millions of
19:26
years somehow coming together
19:27
reproducing and producing integrals that
19:29
are viable so that's a huge limitation
19:32
for the use of the biological species
19:34
concept
19:37
now another
19:38
concept that is commonly used to define
19:41
a species is what is called the genetic
19:43
species concept in this case this
19:45
concept uses the similarity
19:48
the genetic similar genetic or molecular
19:51
similarity among a species
19:53
right basically what you do you take
19:55
these molecules as i explained to you
19:57
either protein or dna compare that among
19:59
different species and that allows you
20:01
then to differentiate different species
20:04
and that turns then into what is called
20:06
the genetic species concept again trying
20:09
to differentiate the degree to which
20:11
species are different different based on
20:13
their molecular molecular
20:16
composition
20:18
however that concept is not quite
20:20
perfect yet though because unfortunately
20:22
what is the threshold that you use and
20:24
what percentage of difference you say a
20:26
species
20:27
is a species
20:29
right so here you can see for instance
20:31
the genetic similarity among different
20:34
species on a given molecule and you can
20:36
see that these differences molecular
20:39
differences are quite different between
20:41
things that we clearly identify as
20:43
different species today so unfortunately
20:46
that's kind of the the limitation of the
20:48
genetic species concept is the fact that
20:50
it's very hard for us to come up with a
20:51
threshold that will allow us to separate
20:53
all of the species that we know in the
20:55
planet because as you can see here there
20:56
are clearly things are different species
20:58
that have different levels of genetic
21:00
differentiation
21:03
now
21:04
certain times you see me using the word
21:06
species and population but i want to
21:08
clarify that those two things are
21:10
different there are certain times that
21:11
they kind of can be used in the same way
21:13
but they are actually very different as
21:15
i explained to you species are normally
21:16
organisms that it can be either they're
21:20
reproduced with each other and the
21:21
oceans are viable or they are
21:22
genetically similar but a population
21:25
though
21:26
are groups of individuals of the same
21:28
species okay so i need you to keep to
21:30
keep that distinction
21:32
in mind again a population are discrete
21:35
groups of individuals of the same
21:37
species
21:38
all the species is what we just
21:40
described
21:41
and that's the class for today and i see
21:43
you guys in the next episode
