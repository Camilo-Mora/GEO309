Introduction
0:03
right so welcome to the last lecture of
0:06
this course
0:08
we're going to be looking at the future
0:10
of biodiversity up to now we have review
0:14
how life could to be what it is and we
0:16
analyze patterns on body's eyes
0:19
but it's in richness abundance and body
0:22
size and we also analyze how the species
0:26
interact those three attributes interact
0:28
at a local scale to create the
0:30
functioning of ecosystems today i want
0:32
us to see what is in the future
0:34
what is in the future for biodiversity
0:37
and i want to contextualize the whole
0:38
thing starting from the beginning and
0:41
again the first thing that i want us to
0:42
do is to put into perspective
0:44
what we had at stake here again as i
0:46
established earlier there could be
0:48
easily a hundred billion planets like
0:50
are like like arsenal air like planets
0:54
however only about 10 of them are likely
0:56
to meet the characteristics of our
0:58
planet meaning that the probability of
1:00
us fighting another planet like ours are
1:02
in one are one in one billion that is
1:04
statistic for me it's just staggering
1:06
you know just for you to realize the
1:08
significance of the planet and the uni
1:10
uniqueness of the planet that that we
1:13
are looking to live in
1:15
this is a
1:17
some photographs from the bodyguard one
1:20
and here you can see the different
1:22
planets photographed from the different
1:23
planets including or planet earth you
1:25
can see that in reality you were to see
1:27
from outer space we are so insignificant
1:30
you know like a tiny minuscule
1:33
grain of sand in the
1:36
size of the universe we are just not
1:38
like much yet we are so different we
1:40
established in this class that there are
1:43
several characteristics that are super
1:45
important for there to be life all of
1:47
them met in this planet the chances of
1:49
these characteristics in combination
1:52
happening given place are almost
1:54
non-existent that we know of
1:57
we also established that once those
1:59
characteristics became available
2:01
in our planet earth all what it took was
2:05
for that beginning to happen you know
2:07
the protocell or the eukaryote for you
2:09
to have a huge diversity of species that
2:12
manage to to get to what we see today in
2:15
the order of 8.7 8.9 million species
2:20
and those species once they originated
2:22
they got to be everywhere they colonized
2:24
not only the land but they also
2:26
colonized the oceans they got to have
2:29
all kinds of sizes from individuals that
2:31
we can barely see with a microscope
2:33
between the rules that are huge they
2:36
also got to be huge
2:38
variations in their abundances from a
2:40
species that are counted by the millions
2:42
to the species that are in contact with
2:44
your we with with the fingers of a hand
2:47
unfortunately at the end of that
2:49
beautiful process of evolution of
2:52
of life in our planet
2:55
we came about if you look at who we are
2:57
in the context of all of the species
2:59
that which are the planet we are just
3:00
like nothing one out of 8.9 million
3:03
species
3:04
yet we had such an in such a significant
3:07
footprint on the life of this planet
3:09
already we established that we as a
3:12
species we probably migrated from africa
3:14
a couple times and again it didn't take
3:16
very long by comparison to to life in
3:19
this planet to be found everywhere on
3:21
the planet
3:23
unfortunately as we increase our
3:25
distribution and abundance locally we
3:28
also start increasing our impact on the
3:30
planet species that were that were once
3:33
super abundant like this one here there
3:35
are records of this passenger vision to
3:38
be so abundant so that you could look at
3:40
the sky and they will block the sky
3:43
from the ground that's how abundant
3:45
these species were there are comments of
3:46
people suggesting back in the day that
3:48
it would be impossible for them to drive
3:50
this species extinction to extinction as
3:53
people were chewing to these birds to
3:55
kill them for eating them or for using
3:57
their feathers the people that were
3:58
shooting them were making the claim that
4:00
it would be impossible to drive those
4:02
species as things what is the irony that
4:04
in just a hundred years that species was
4:07
driven to extinction the only place
4:09
where you see that species today is as a
4:13
museums
4:14
there are thousands of species that i
4:16
can talk to you about that had gone
4:18
esteem because of our or abuse of nature
4:21
you know and we had established as well
4:24
the reasons for why this is happening in
4:26
a moment i'm gonna explain to you some
4:28
of the drivers of things that we do that
4:31
are influencing the way that life is now
4:34
evolving in our planet again is causing
4:36
one of the major factors affecting
4:39
biodiversity on life which is essential
4:42
just like this over 20 000 species go
4:46
extinct every year 20 000 of them
4:49
we also found that the abundances of
4:51
many of these species are declining and
4:54
we show in the chapter on abundance that
4:56
this decline is happening at all levels
4:58
from terrestrial species from marine
5:00
species to fresh water species we also
5:03
show that the body sizes of the species
5:05
are shrinking this is a paper by william
5:08
shawn showing how when you look at
5:10
different taxonomic groups and whether
5:13
they are inc declining or increasing as
5:16
a response of climate change what you
5:17
find is that most of the species are
5:19
actually declining in body size in the
5:22
chapter in body size we showed that one
5:24
of the worrisome signs of a species
5:26
shrinking their body size is that that's
5:28
what happened normally in the past two
5:30
species that had gone extinct
trophic cascades
5:34
unfortunately these impacts that we're
5:36
having in nature are beyond
5:38
the impasse on the species that we
5:40
impact directly that's what is called
5:42
trophic cascades basically what happens
5:44
sorry i made a spelling mistake here is
5:46
tropic with h and y
5:48
basically what happens here is that we
5:50
start affecting certain taxonomic groups
5:53
like for instance here in this case top
5:55
predators and you can see the density of
5:58
these top predators declining for many
6:00
species this is data on different
6:02
species of charts over time and you can
6:04
see on all of the
6:06
species there is an increase in decline
6:09
now given that this species of sharks
6:12
feed on on up giving a prey no surprise
6:15
then the prey is actually increasing
6:17
their abundances you can see the manta
6:19
ray densities here all of them increases
6:21
their density now everything that the
6:24
the manta ray
6:25
feed on then no surprise because the
6:28
populations are increasing then the
6:29
density of the prey will decline and
6:32
this is what is called trophic cascades
6:34
again are consequences
6:37
to entire ecosystems
6:39
by us impacting a few species that's
6:42
what is called a trophic cascade
6:44
basically given this trophic
6:46
relationship between species when we
6:48
impact one species chances are that we
6:50
might impact other species indirectly as
6:53
well via what is called a trophic
6:55
cascade
alternative equilibrium states
6:57
unfortunately these impacts that we see
6:59
in nature will be forever i don't know
7:02
where in hell we are coming with the
7:03
idea that many of these impacts are
7:05
going to be reduced or that we're going
7:06
to fix nature once we start getting
7:08
worried about nature turns out that we
7:10
also have the science to suggest that
7:12
many of these impacts might be
7:14
irreversible this is thanks to what is
7:16
called alternative equilibrium states
7:18
the idea here is that populations of
7:21
species are adapted to local ecosystems
7:24
to local conditions once you stress that
7:27
population the species will try to adapt
7:30
and basically adaptation means that
7:31
there are some genes some genes that are
7:33
not suitable to survive on those
7:35
conditions meaning that all of those
7:36
genes will disappear the genes that are
7:39
left are suitable and those are the ones
7:41
that will make them the population
7:42
moving forward but what it means is that
7:44
all of those genes
7:46
that we're doing to extinction they're
7:47
not coming back baby they're going for
7:50
for good now so what it means is that if
7:52
we remove the stressor this population
7:55
is not going to go back to what it was
7:57
before because those genes again as the
7:59
process of adaptation was playing out
8:01
make all of those genes when esteemed
8:03
now what is even more worrisome is that
8:06
once we start driving these populations
8:07
to very low levels the populations will
8:10
drive themselves to extinction in what
8:12
is called an extinction vortex and there
8:13
are different
8:15
processes that lead to those extinction
8:17
vortexes one is called deposition
8:20
and basically what happens in
8:21
depreciation is also called the aliyah
8:23
fed what happens here is that when you
8:25
had individuals that are few
8:28
they are so far apart that they don't
8:29
find each other good examples of this
8:31
for instance are sharks the populations
8:33
of sharks have been reduced to so few
8:35
numbers that the sharks are so far apart
8:36
in the oceans that they cannot find each
8:38
other if they don't find each other then
8:40
they don't reproduce and then
8:42
they have less input to the populations
8:44
and the populations will decline by
8:46
themselves this is again a consequence
8:48
of us stressing the populations at the
8:50
top another example for instance our
8:52
coral reefs coral reefs
8:54
the actual individuals they are dying
8:56
off on the coral reefs and the few that
8:58
are left are so far apart on the ribs
9:00
that when they produce the offspring the
9:02
offsprings cannot find themselves in the
9:04
water and they cannot fertilize
9:07
there is also genetic losses with this
9:09
genetic loss another cause of these
9:12
extinction vortex is the fact that when
9:14
you have fewer individuals left
9:17
the ones that are left reproduce we show
9:19
there are most likely what they are are
9:20
close relatives so basically when they
9:22
are having in the populations that are
9:25
made out of fathers and sisters sisters
9:27
reproducing with brothers and that
9:29
creates an imbrind operation that
9:31
aggravates the the decline of the
9:33
populations with the loss of genetic
9:35
diversity as well you obviously reduce
9:37
the chances that the species might be
9:39
able to resist other environmental
9:41
factors down the road and again
9:44
that's what is called an extinction
9:46
vortex that is caused when we take these
9:48
populations way too low in pop in in
9:51
their in their abundances and they
9:53
failed many times to recover from this
mass extinction
9:57
unfortunately
9:58
this is something that is happening at
10:00
the level of many species and there are
10:02
multiple stories already showing that we
10:04
are a diverse of a mass extinction event
10:07
given the current race of extinctions
10:09
that we observe among a species is
10:11
easily that in the next 100 years we can
10:13
cross the trestle of what has in the
10:16
past caused mass extinction events
10:18
moments in the history of the planet
10:19
when over 70 to 75 percent of the
10:22
species in the planet when esteemed
10:24
in those cases back in the day
10:26
most likely it was volcanoes and plate
10:29
tectonics and meteorites
10:31
now is us you know again a massive
10:35
force of extinction in the planet
drivers of extinction
10:38
we also established that
10:40
why why are we doing this we already
10:42
know the mathematics on that very well
10:44
we know that the major drivers of those
10:47
species going to staying are things like
10:48
overexploitation or exploitation is
10:51
basically when we exploit populations
10:54
beyond the natural levels of
10:56
replenishment this is like you
10:58
having money in the bank and taking more
11:00
money out of the bank than the money
11:01
that you put in basically what happens
11:03
over time is that you will go bankrupt
11:05
so this is exactly what is happening to
11:07
many of these populations we are killing
11:08
a lot more individuals out of the
11:10
populations than the individuals that
11:12
can be reproduced in that population
11:16
another factor that is
11:18
driving a lot of species down shrinking
11:21
their body sizes and leading them to
11:23
extinction is habitat loss habitat loss
11:26
is defined generally speaking as the
11:27
reduction of hospitable locations for an
11:29
individual of a species to survive
11:32
so normally we think about habitat loss
11:34
like us going and cutting the forest and
11:36
it's something that is super obvious but
11:38
habitat loss also has multiple forms to
11:41
impact biodiversity like for instance
11:43
you can imagine things like pollution
11:46
that makes habitats completely unusable
11:49
for a species when you come and build
11:51
roads those habitats become again
11:53
something that species cannot use so
11:54
habitat loss is a broader definition
11:56
that us just going and cutting down
11:58
trees is us making habitats un able to
12:01
support species
12:04
we also have the big boy these days
12:06
which is climate change and basically
12:08
what we have found is that with these
12:09
increases in temperature there are
12:11
multiple changes that are happening on
12:12
the species the species are becoming
12:14
smaller they are producing further fewer
12:17
offspring their abundances are
12:19
declining as well
stressors
12:23
that's not to say that we're not paying
12:24
attention obviously a lot of people
12:26
around the world is very concerned on
12:28
this thing and what we have observed is
12:30
that when you look at the stress or
12:31
things that we are doing like what i
12:33
just described over exploitation habitat
12:35
loss climate change all of those
12:36
stressors are increasing over time
12:39
obviously
12:41
what is happening simultaneously is that
12:44
there are a lot of initiatives what is
12:46
refined referred here as mitigation
12:48
policies that are also increasing
12:50
obviously people around the world is
12:51
concerned about this thing many of us
12:53
are concerned and as a result several
12:55
governments are putting regulations to
12:57
to stop
12:59
these stressors yet when you look at
13:01
what's happening to biodiversity
13:02
biodiversity is declining
13:05
this is a paper that was published by
13:07
buchar basically the point that this
13:09
paper is making is that despite the fact
13:11
that we can quantify the stressors
13:14
despite the fact that we are making
13:16
things to reduce those stressors
13:18
it seems that there are still very
13:19
significant to to cope with the
13:22
environmental crisis that we had in our
13:24
hands because you see biodiversity going
13:26
down despite the fact that there are
13:27
these efforts going up
future is up
13:30
so what is in the future is up this is
13:33
an analysis that i published that i
13:35
introduced early on and it's this idea
13:37
that basically if you look at the number
13:40
of people over time and multiply that by
13:43
by the amount of area that is required
13:45
by every individual and divide that by
13:48
the amount of land that is available you
13:50
ended up calculating the number of
13:52
planets that are required to sustain
13:55
humanity and what we showed back in the
13:57
day is that we already the number of
13:59
people already surpassed the number of
14:01
people that can be sustained well by the
14:04
planet
14:05
the reason why we have more people that
14:07
the planet can sustain explains why do
14:10
you have a lot of people going hungry or
14:11
why a lot of species are going extinct
14:14
this is status of overshot could lead to
14:17
potentially us being on an ecological
14:19
debt on the order of 2725 planet earth
14:22
by 2050.
environmental generational amnesia
14:25
unfortunately the evidence suggests that
14:28
we might not care this is mind-blowing
14:30
to me even the science
14:32
suggests to you that despite the fact
14:34
that we are so concerned and we're doing
14:37
so many things the reality is that over
14:39
time we're gonna care even less and less
14:41
and less for this this is what is called
14:43
normally referred this is what is
14:44
normally referred as environmental
14:46
generational amnesia or shifting
14:48
baseline the idea is this
14:51
imagine time here on this axis and this
14:54
is biodiversity how beautiful it looks
14:56
it turns out that if biodiversity is
14:58
declining there is a generation at a
15:00
given point of or early people that saw
15:04
biodiversity at the peak and they had a
15:06
reference point of how biodiversity was
15:08
used to look like by the time that they
15:10
die they can look back and they realize
15:12
wow biodiversity is declining the reason
15:15
being that they had this reference point
15:16
when they were children
15:18
now
15:19
then we come along and now our reference
15:22
point is much lower so we don't see the
15:24
change unfortunately the the change can
15:27
only be appreciated when we see it and
15:29
the only ones that saw that that change
15:31
that reference point well the elderly
15:33
that die off so over time what happens
15:36
is that our generation start having
15:38
lower and lower references points of how
15:41
the biodiversity was look like
15:44
and and given the fact that we don't
15:46
seem to see the change then the chances
15:48
that we are going to care are even less
15:50
and less and less
15:52
so unfortunately i had to finish my
15:55
class i want you i want you to picture
15:57
all of this we are taking a beautiful
15:59
thing that is life in the planet that
16:01
has diversified
16:03
that providing important goods and
16:04
services to humanity that we are
16:07
destroying
16:08
at a rate in which those resources
16:10
cannot supply people cannot supply the
16:14
resources needed by everybody and at a
16:17
time when we don't seem to care so the
16:19
only conclusion that i can finish with
16:21
this class is to say that we are screw
16:25
you want to see how screw we are i want
16:27
you to take my following class where we
16:29
talk about what we are doing to prosper
16:32
biodiversity at the end of the class
16:33
though there is a i might finish up on
16:36
that class with a sense of hope that
16:38
there might be
16:40
still a potential path for us to to fix
16:43
this at this moment unfortunately at
16:45
this moment the evidence suggests that
16:47
we are pretty much a screw and with that
16:49

Introduction
0:03
right so welcome to the last lecture of
0:06
this course
0:08
we're going to be looking at the future
0:10
of biodiversity up to now we have review
0:14
how life could to be what it is and we
0:16
analyze patterns on body's eyes
0:19
but it's in richness abundance and body
0:22
size and we also analyze how the species
0:26
interact those three attributes interact
0:28
at a local scale to create the
0:30
functioning of ecosystems today i want
0:32
us to see what is in the future
0:34
what is in the future for biodiversity
0:37
and i want to contextualize the whole
0:38
thing starting from the beginning and
0:41
again the first thing that i want us to
0:42
do is to put into perspective
0:44
what we had at stake here again as i
0:46
established earlier there could be
0:48
easily a hundred billion planets like
0:50
are like like arsenal air like planets
0:54
however only about 10 of them are likely
0:56
to meet the characteristics of our
0:58
planet meaning that the probability of
1:00
us fighting another planet like ours are
1:02
in one are one in one billion that is
1:04
statistic for me it's just staggering
1:06
you know just for you to realize the
1:08
significance of the planet and the uni
1:10
uniqueness of the planet that that we
1:13
are looking to live in
1:15
this is a
1:17
some photographs from the bodyguard one
1:20
and here you can see the different
1:22
planets photographed from the different
1:23
planets including or planet earth you
1:25
can see that in reality you were to see
1:27
from outer space we are so insignificant
1:30
you know like a tiny minuscule
1:33
grain of sand in the
1:36
size of the universe we are just not
1:38
like much yet we are so different we
1:40
established in this class that there are
1:43
several characteristics that are super
1:45
important for there to be life all of
1:47
them met in this planet the chances of
1:49
these characteristics in combination
1:52
happening given place are almost
1:54
non-existent that we know of
1:57
we also established that once those
1:59
characteristics became available
2:01
in our planet earth all what it took was
2:05
for that beginning to happen you know
2:07
the protocell or the eukaryote for you
2:09
to have a huge diversity of species that
2:12
manage to to get to what we see today in
2:15
the order of 8.7 8.9 million species
2:20
and those species once they originated
2:22
they got to be everywhere they colonized
2:24
not only the land but they also
2:26
colonized the oceans they got to have
2:29
all kinds of sizes from individuals that
2:31
we can barely see with a microscope
2:33
between the rules that are huge they
2:36
also got to be huge
2:38
variations in their abundances from a
2:40
species that are counted by the millions
2:42
to the species that are in contact with
2:44
your we with with the fingers of a hand
2:47
unfortunately at the end of that
2:49
beautiful process of evolution of
2:52
of life in our planet
2:55
we came about if you look at who we are
2:57
in the context of all of the species
2:59
that which are the planet we are just
3:00
like nothing one out of 8.9 million
3:03
species
3:04
yet we had such an in such a significant
3:07
footprint on the life of this planet
3:09
already we established that we as a
3:12
species we probably migrated from africa
3:14
a couple times and again it didn't take
3:16
very long by comparison to to life in
3:19
this planet to be found everywhere on
3:21
the planet
3:23
unfortunately as we increase our
3:25
distribution and abundance locally we
3:28
also start increasing our impact on the
3:30
planet species that were that were once
3:33
super abundant like this one here there
3:35
are records of this passenger vision to
3:38
be so abundant so that you could look at
3:40
the sky and they will block the sky
3:43
from the ground that's how abundant
3:45
these species were there are comments of
3:46
people suggesting back in the day that
3:48
it would be impossible for them to drive
3:50
this species extinction to extinction as
3:53
people were chewing to these birds to
3:55
kill them for eating them or for using
3:57
their feathers the people that were
3:58
shooting them were making the claim that
4:00
it would be impossible to drive those
4:02
species as things what is the irony that
4:04
in just a hundred years that species was
4:07
driven to extinction the only place
4:09
where you see that species today is as a
4:13
museums
4:14
there are thousands of species that i
4:16
can talk to you about that had gone
4:18
esteem because of our or abuse of nature
4:21
you know and we had established as well
4:24
the reasons for why this is happening in
4:26
a moment i'm gonna explain to you some
4:28
of the drivers of things that we do that
4:31
are influencing the way that life is now
4:34
evolving in our planet again is causing
4:36
one of the major factors affecting
4:39
biodiversity on life which is essential
4:42
just like this over 20 000 species go
4:46
extinct every year 20 000 of them
4:49
we also found that the abundances of
4:51
many of these species are declining and
4:54
we show in the chapter on abundance that
4:56
this decline is happening at all levels
4:58
from terrestrial species from marine
5:00
species to fresh water species we also
5:03
show that the body sizes of the species
5:05
are shrinking this is a paper by william
5:08
shawn showing how when you look at
5:10
different taxonomic groups and whether
5:13
they are inc declining or increasing as
5:16
a response of climate change what you
5:17
find is that most of the species are
5:19
actually declining in body size in the
5:22
chapter in body size we showed that one
5:24
of the worrisome signs of a species
5:26
shrinking their body size is that that's
5:28
what happened normally in the past two
5:30
species that had gone extinct
trophic cascades
5:34
unfortunately these impacts that we're
5:36
having in nature are beyond
5:38
the impasse on the species that we
5:40
impact directly that's what is called
5:42
trophic cascades basically what happens
5:44
sorry i made a spelling mistake here is
5:46
tropic with h and y
5:48
basically what happens here is that we
5:50
start affecting certain taxonomic groups
5:53
like for instance here in this case top
5:55
predators and you can see the density of
5:58
these top predators declining for many
6:00
species this is data on different
6:02
species of charts over time and you can
6:04
see on all of the
6:06
species there is an increase in decline
6:09
now given that this species of sharks
6:12
feed on on up giving a prey no surprise
6:15
then the prey is actually increasing
6:17
their abundances you can see the manta
6:19
ray densities here all of them increases
6:21
their density now everything that the
6:24
the manta ray
6:25
feed on then no surprise because the
6:28
populations are increasing then the
6:29
density of the prey will decline and
6:32
this is what is called trophic cascades
6:34
again are consequences
6:37
to entire ecosystems
6:39
by us impacting a few species that's
6:42
what is called a trophic cascade
6:44
basically given this trophic
6:46
relationship between species when we
6:48
impact one species chances are that we
6:50
might impact other species indirectly as
6:53
well via what is called a trophic
6:55
cascade
alternative equilibrium states
6:57
unfortunately these impacts that we see
6:59
in nature will be forever i don't know
7:02
where in hell we are coming with the
7:03
idea that many of these impacts are
7:05
going to be reduced or that we're going
7:06
to fix nature once we start getting
7:08
worried about nature turns out that we
7:10
also have the science to suggest that
7:12
many of these impacts might be
7:14
irreversible this is thanks to what is
7:16
called alternative equilibrium states
7:18
the idea here is that populations of
7:21
species are adapted to local ecosystems
7:24
to local conditions once you stress that
7:27
population the species will try to adapt
7:30
and basically adaptation means that
7:31
there are some genes some genes that are
7:33
not suitable to survive on those
7:35
conditions meaning that all of those
7:36
genes will disappear the genes that are
7:39
left are suitable and those are the ones
7:41
that will make them the population
7:42
moving forward but what it means is that
7:44
all of those genes
7:46
that we're doing to extinction they're
7:47
not coming back baby they're going for
7:50
for good now so what it means is that if
7:52
we remove the stressor this population
7:55
is not going to go back to what it was
7:57
before because those genes again as the
7:59
process of adaptation was playing out
8:01
make all of those genes when esteemed
8:03
now what is even more worrisome is that
8:06
once we start driving these populations
8:07
to very low levels the populations will
8:10
drive themselves to extinction in what
8:12
is called an extinction vortex and there
8:13
are different
8:15
processes that lead to those extinction
8:17
vortexes one is called deposition
8:20
and basically what happens in
8:21
depreciation is also called the aliyah
8:23
fed what happens here is that when you
8:25
had individuals that are few
8:28
they are so far apart that they don't
8:29
find each other good examples of this
8:31
for instance are sharks the populations
8:33
of sharks have been reduced to so few
8:35
numbers that the sharks are so far apart
8:36
in the oceans that they cannot find each
8:38
other if they don't find each other then
8:40
they don't reproduce and then
8:42
they have less input to the populations
8:44
and the populations will decline by
8:46
themselves this is again a consequence
8:48
of us stressing the populations at the
8:50
top another example for instance our
8:52
coral reefs coral reefs
8:54
the actual individuals they are dying
8:56
off on the coral reefs and the few that
8:58
are left are so far apart on the ribs
9:00
that when they produce the offspring the
9:02
offsprings cannot find themselves in the
9:04
water and they cannot fertilize
9:07
there is also genetic losses with this
9:09
genetic loss another cause of these
9:12
extinction vortex is the fact that when
9:14
you have fewer individuals left
9:17
the ones that are left reproduce we show
9:19
there are most likely what they are are
9:20
close relatives so basically when they
9:22
are having in the populations that are
9:25
made out of fathers and sisters sisters
9:27
reproducing with brothers and that
9:29
creates an imbrind operation that
9:31
aggravates the the decline of the
9:33
populations with the loss of genetic
9:35
diversity as well you obviously reduce
9:37
the chances that the species might be
9:39
able to resist other environmental
9:41
factors down the road and again
9:44
that's what is called an extinction
9:46
vortex that is caused when we take these
9:48
populations way too low in pop in in
9:51
their in their abundances and they
9:53
failed many times to recover from this
mass extinction
9:57
unfortunately
9:58
this is something that is happening at
10:00
the level of many species and there are
10:02
multiple stories already showing that we
10:04
are a diverse of a mass extinction event
10:07
given the current race of extinctions
10:09
that we observe among a species is
10:11
easily that in the next 100 years we can
10:13
cross the trestle of what has in the
10:16
past caused mass extinction events
10:18
moments in the history of the planet
10:19
when over 70 to 75 percent of the
10:22
species in the planet when esteemed
10:24
in those cases back in the day
10:26
most likely it was volcanoes and plate
10:29
tectonics and meteorites
10:31
now is us you know again a massive
10:35
force of extinction in the planet
drivers of extinction
10:38
we also established that
10:40
why why are we doing this we already
10:42
know the mathematics on that very well
10:44
we know that the major drivers of those
10:47
species going to staying are things like
10:48
overexploitation or exploitation is
10:51
basically when we exploit populations
10:54
beyond the natural levels of
10:56
replenishment this is like you
10:58
having money in the bank and taking more
11:00
money out of the bank than the money
11:01
that you put in basically what happens
11:03
over time is that you will go bankrupt
11:05
so this is exactly what is happening to
11:07
many of these populations we are killing
11:08
a lot more individuals out of the
11:10
populations than the individuals that
11:12
can be reproduced in that population
11:16
another factor that is
11:18
driving a lot of species down shrinking
11:21
their body sizes and leading them to
11:23
extinction is habitat loss habitat loss
11:26
is defined generally speaking as the
11:27
reduction of hospitable locations for an
11:29
individual of a species to survive
11:32
so normally we think about habitat loss
11:34
like us going and cutting the forest and
11:36
it's something that is super obvious but
11:38
habitat loss also has multiple forms to
11:41
impact biodiversity like for instance
11:43
you can imagine things like pollution
11:46
that makes habitats completely unusable
11:49
for a species when you come and build
11:51
roads those habitats become again
11:53
something that species cannot use so
11:54
habitat loss is a broader definition
11:56
that us just going and cutting down
11:58
trees is us making habitats un able to
12:01
support species
12:04
we also have the big boy these days
12:06
which is climate change and basically
12:08
what we have found is that with these
12:09
increases in temperature there are
12:11
multiple changes that are happening on
12:12
the species the species are becoming
12:14
smaller they are producing further fewer
12:17
offspring their abundances are
12:19
declining as well
stressors
12:23
that's not to say that we're not paying
12:24
attention obviously a lot of people
12:26
around the world is very concerned on
12:28
this thing and what we have observed is
12:30
that when you look at the stress or
12:31
things that we are doing like what i
12:33
just described over exploitation habitat
12:35
loss climate change all of those
12:36
stressors are increasing over time
12:39
obviously
12:41
what is happening simultaneously is that
12:44
there are a lot of initiatives what is
12:46
refined referred here as mitigation
12:48
policies that are also increasing
12:50
obviously people around the world is
12:51
concerned about this thing many of us
12:53
are concerned and as a result several
12:55
governments are putting regulations to
12:57
to stop
12:59
these stressors yet when you look at
13:01
what's happening to biodiversity
13:02
biodiversity is declining
13:05
this is a paper that was published by
13:07
buchar basically the point that this
13:09
paper is making is that despite the fact
13:11
that we can quantify the stressors
13:14
despite the fact that we are making
13:16
things to reduce those stressors
13:18
it seems that there are still very
13:19
significant to to cope with the
13:22
environmental crisis that we had in our
13:24
hands because you see biodiversity going
13:26
down despite the fact that there are
13:27
these efforts going up
future is up
13:30
so what is in the future is up this is
13:33
an analysis that i published that i
13:35
introduced early on and it's this idea
13:37
that basically if you look at the number
13:40
of people over time and multiply that by
13:43
by the amount of area that is required
13:45
by every individual and divide that by
13:48
the amount of land that is available you
13:50
ended up calculating the number of
13:52
planets that are required to sustain
13:55
humanity and what we showed back in the
13:57
day is that we already the number of
13:59
people already surpassed the number of
14:01
people that can be sustained well by the
14:04
planet
14:05
the reason why we have more people that
14:07
the planet can sustain explains why do
14:10
you have a lot of people going hungry or
14:11
why a lot of species are going extinct
14:14
this is status of overshot could lead to
14:17
potentially us being on an ecological
14:19
debt on the order of 2725 planet earth
14:22
by 2050.
environmental generational amnesia
14:25
unfortunately the evidence suggests that
14:28
we might not care this is mind-blowing
14:30
to me even the science
14:32
suggests to you that despite the fact
14:34
that we are so concerned and we're doing
14:37
so many things the reality is that over
14:39
time we're gonna care even less and less
14:41
and less for this this is what is called
14:43
normally referred this is what is
14:44
normally referred as environmental
14:46
generational amnesia or shifting
14:48
baseline the idea is this
14:51
imagine time here on this axis and this
14:54
is biodiversity how beautiful it looks
14:56
it turns out that if biodiversity is
14:58
declining there is a generation at a
15:00
given point of or early people that saw
15:04
biodiversity at the peak and they had a
15:06
reference point of how biodiversity was
15:08
used to look like by the time that they
15:10
die they can look back and they realize
15:12
wow biodiversity is declining the reason
15:15
being that they had this reference point
15:16
when they were children
15:18
now
15:19
then we come along and now our reference
15:22
point is much lower so we don't see the
15:24
change unfortunately the the change can
15:27
only be appreciated when we see it and
15:29
the only ones that saw that that change
15:31
that reference point well the elderly
15:33
that die off so over time what happens
15:36
is that our generation start having
15:38
lower and lower references points of how
15:41
the biodiversity was look like
15:44
and and given the fact that we don't
15:46
seem to see the change then the chances
15:48
that we are going to care are even less
15:50
and less and less
15:52
so unfortunately i had to finish my
15:55
class i want you i want you to picture
15:57
all of this we are taking a beautiful
15:59
thing that is life in the planet that
16:01
has diversified
16:03
that providing important goods and
16:04
services to humanity that we are
16:07
destroying
16:08
at a rate in which those resources
16:10
cannot supply people cannot supply the
16:14
resources needed by everybody and at a
16:17
time when we don't seem to care so the
16:19
only conclusion that i can finish with
16:21
this class is to say that we are screw
16:25
you want to see how screw we are i want
16:27
you to take my following class where we
16:29
talk about what we are doing to prosper
16:32
biodiversity at the end of the class
16:33
though there is a i might finish up on
16:36
that class with a sense of hope that
16:38
there might be
16:40
still a potential path for us to to fix
16:43
this at this moment unfortunately at
16:45
this moment the evidence suggests that
16:47
we are pretty much a screw and with that
16:49
