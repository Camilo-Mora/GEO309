Intro
0:06
all right so today we're going to be
0:08
looking at body size but before i get
0:10
started with this class let's find out
0:12
how did we get here so we established
0:14
that
0:15
they were probably 4.6 billion years and
0:19
since planet earth was created then they
0:21
were about
0:22
1.1 billion years since we got our moon
0:25
and they were about after that time 4.6
0:28
billion years we had to wait about a
0:30
billion years for the first forms of
0:32
light to come which were called the
0:34
prokaryotes during the first billion
0:36
years in the history of the planet what
0:38
was cooking there was this thing called
0:40
the protocell again it's not really a
0:42
life form by itself but it was like a
0:45
plastic bag that allows molecules to be
0:47
contained and that kind of became the
0:49
precursor for you to get life once the
0:52
life came out
0:53
came out you get the prokaryotes
0:56
then from the prokaryotes we had to wait
0:58
a certain amount of time to get the
0:59
eukaryotes and next thing you know we
1:01
had a
1:03
8.7 8.9 million species that we are
1:06
sharing the planet with
1:07
all right now
1:09
however we also established though that
1:11
once the species originated via one of
1:13
four different pathways they started
1:15
spreading their distributions until they
1:18
get to an area that they will occupy for
1:20
a certain amount of time that area comes
1:22
to be called as the geographical range
1:25
one consequence of you having many
1:27
species overlapping their ranges is that
1:29
when you go and count how many species
1:30
are in a given place that leads you to
1:32
something that is called the pattern in
1:34
species richness
1:35
so
1:36
another attribute that will change those
1:38
you have many species living on
1:40
environments and adapting to those
1:41
environments and competing with them is
1:44
the fact that they they had to also
1:45
start modifying certain certain
1:48
characteristics of of
1:50
of the species one of them being body
1:52
size and the other attribute being
1:54
biomass
1:55
abundance
Energy Allocation
1:57
so
1:58
we already established that we just got
2:00
to be super lucky in our solar system by
2:03
having seven eight attributes that make
2:05
life possible in our planet one of those
2:07
attributes that is super important is
2:09
the amount of energy that we get from
2:10
the sun
2:11
so basically if you look at that energy
2:14
that comes from here right away that
2:16
energy gets converted by a species into
2:18
biomass and as you can appreciate right
2:20
here the amount of energy that we get is
2:23
going to change quite a lot from place
2:25
to place once the biomass is allocated
2:27
by the species then the species will
2:30
have to start again interacting with
2:32
them and that's going to start modifying
2:33
their body mass
2:35
their body mass and also their abundance
2:37
so one of the things that you will see
2:39
when you analyze these three attributes
2:40
of the species body size the richness of
2:43
the species or their abundance is that
2:45
commonly those three attributes in a
2:47
given community are highly correlated to
2:51
each other and again most commonly is
2:53
because depending on
2:55
the way that species allocate that
2:56
energy and how they optimize the use of
2:58
the energy of different places
Body Size
3:01
let's jump right away into body size so
3:03
obviously it's very clear for you right
3:05
now when you look at nature that
3:06
different species have different body
3:08
sizes for biogeographers it has been an
3:10
interesting question why why the species
3:13
do have the body science that they do
3:15
after years of analyzing this question
3:17
and collecting data they found that
3:20
when you look at the body size of a
3:21
given species it turns out that there
3:23
are several ecological and evolutionary
3:25
forces that a species had to deal with
3:28
so
3:29
well it turns out that depending on
3:31
these evolutionary and ecological forces
3:34
the body size is going to have a cost
3:36
right
3:37
but there is also going to be a benefit
3:39
to having that body size and basically
3:41
it's at this trade-off at this optimum
3:43
where the cause is equal to the benefit
3:46
that most likely will determine the body
3:48
size of the species think about it if
3:50
for some reason you are living in an
3:52
environment that has a huge
3:54
environmental cause for you to have a
3:55
large body size evolution is going to
3:57
start forcing you to have a smaller body
4:00
size the same thing goes places that
4:02
there may be an excess of energy or
4:04
perhaps little competition well in that
4:06
case there's a benefit for you there is
4:08
not going to be cause and there is a lot
4:10
of surplus of energy so most likely on
4:12
those places you are going to see body
4:13
size going up
4:15
so again
4:16
when you look at body size basically
4:19
what we are talking about is those
4:20
trade-offs between the costs and
4:21
benefits in relationship to ecological
4:24
and evolutionary forces and then what we
4:26
are going to be looking at today are
4:28
what are these forces equal from the
4:30
ecology and evolution that cause
4:33
trade-offs that will influence the body
4:35
size
Resources
4:37
obviously when you think about how big
4:39
you can be one of the first drivers that
4:41
you can think of is how much energy or
4:44
resources are available in one place
4:47
here is a very a
4:49
common pattern that is found in nature
4:51
basically when you look at the metabolic
4:53
rate which is the amount of energy that
4:55
is used by a species over time via
4:58
against the body size of that species
5:00
what you find
5:02
is that species that are large
5:04
a
5:05
normally used require a lot of energy so
5:08
they will need a lot of resources while
5:11
species that are small obviously they
5:12
don't use as much energy so the
5:14
resources that they need are smaller and
5:16
again this is a
5:18
pattern that is found throughout almost
5:21
everywhere in nature the bigger you are
5:24
the more energy you will need to sustain
5:26
that body
5:28
now then if you put
5:30
this in
5:32
pattern
5:33
into a given landscape in which the
5:36
amount of energy is going to change then
5:38
what you will find is that any time that
5:39
the resource are available reduces the
5:43
consequence of that is that the body
5:44
size will decrease right so again if
5:47
there is going to be
5:49
certain less energy required when you
5:51
are a small and the amount of energy
5:53
that is available is small that's going
5:55
to force you to become a smaller as well
5:58
the opposite is also true anytime that
6:00
the amount of resources increase then
6:03
obviously you can afford to have a large
6:05
body size and that is again kind of the
6:08
theory behind
6:09
the possibility that the amount of
6:11
resources or energy that is available in
6:13
one place is going to determine how big
6:14
the species are going to get on those
6:16
places however when it comes to the
6:19
to support inspiring there is not really
6:21
a lot this is one of the fewer papers
6:23
that you will find
6:25
about
6:26
the impact of the availability of
6:28
resources on body size so this is the
6:31
moment here the distribution of the
6:33
mammoth 41 000 years ago is shown here
6:35
in green red and yellow you can see that
6:38
the moment was distributed quite
6:40
extensively on the asia and europe
6:44
and by 2000 years ago
6:47
you should now start being patched
6:48
patchy and eventually wednesday 9500
6:51
years ago that's the time when the
6:53
mammoth went to stem now
6:55
that's one thing that we know very well
6:57
on the conti in the continent the
6:59
mammoth went to steam 9500 years ago but
7:02
then these guys came to find this tiny
7:05
this fossil of a mammoth on this island
7:09
called granger island one of the
7:11
interesting aspects of this discovery of
7:13
the mammal on that island is that the
7:15
individuals that were found there were
7:17
25
7:18
percent smaller than the individuals
7:20
that are found on the mainland and the
7:22
fossil shows that this individual
7:24
actually could have been there
7:26
7 000 to 5 000 years seven thousand to
7:29
four thousand years ago that means that
7:31
these animals managed to survive on this
7:33
island five thousand years after they
7:35
went in the continent now why is it
7:38
significant well it turns out that on
7:40
this island there were no humans there
7:42
were no glaciations during that time
7:44
frame suggesting that the reason why the
7:47
u.s got smaller was simply because there
7:50
was not enough resources on that island
7:52
to sustain such a large body size and
7:55
like the mammal that we saw on the
7:57
continent again this is a as you can see
8:00
that paper was polished in the urinal
8:02
nature and the significance of it is
8:03
that they despite the fact that it makes
8:05
a lot of sense
8:07
that the amount of resources will
8:08
influence your body size
8:10
evidence for it is very limited with
8:12
deception again on this one paper here
Predation
8:15
there are also ecological forces that
8:17
will that affect body size so when you
8:19
look at for instance predation which is
8:21
again an ecological interaction between
8:24
species you will have what is called a
8:26
predator something that eats something
8:28
and that something that is being eaten
8:29
is called the prey
8:31
it turns out that this ecological
8:33
interaction can influence body size as
8:35
well and it actually depends of where
8:38
that ecological interaction is happening
8:40
if the ecological interaction for
8:42
instance predation is happening on
8:44
places like coral reefs it has been
8:46
found that there
8:48
the the this the output the consequence
8:51
of predation is to make a species
8:53
especially the prey is smaller right so
8:56
you think about it you are on a reef
8:58
right ribs had a lot of small crevices
9:00
so you are to avoid the predator what
9:02
you really got to do is to become
9:04
smaller in body size so that you can
9:05
hide on those tiny crevices there so you
9:07
get to be big obviously the amount of
9:09
crevices that you find are smaller and
9:11
the higher the chance that you get eaten
9:13
so on coral reefs evolution has made
9:16
possible for predators to drive they
9:19
prey a smaller and then he follows then
9:21
that the predator also will have to
9:23
become a smaller just to be able to
9:24
sneak in and eat their prey
9:27
so again in coral reefs the most
9:30
common consequence of predation is to
9:32
make the prey and the predator smaller
9:34
now in open waters like when you go and
9:36
swim in the middle of the ocean it turns
9:39
out that on those cases the effect of
9:41
predation is actually to make the prey
9:43
bigger
9:44
right obviously you don't have a place
9:46
to hide there so what you gotta do is to
9:48
avoid being eaten by just not feeling
9:51
into the mouth of your predator so on
9:54
open waters the effect of predation is
9:57
for the prey and the predator to become
9:59
bigger
Competition
10:02
another ecological factor that also
10:04
influences
10:06
body size is competition so let's
10:08
imagine for instance for a moment here
10:11
this is the abundance of in if
10:13
individuals of a given species this is
10:14
the resource that is available in a
10:17
given place and let's imagine that you
10:18
have two species using that resource
10:20
right here the two species are in blue
10:23
are in red so as you can imagine here
10:25
what will happen then on this area of
10:27
the resource you had those two species
10:29
using the same resource if they had to
10:32
interact for the use of that resource
10:33
that means that they had to start
10:34
fighting and competing and wasting
10:36
energy defending the use of that
10:38
resource and the u.s are there obviously
10:41
are not as feet because the energy that
10:43
they could invest rather in offspring or
10:45
reproduction they are investing on
10:46
fighting against these other guys
10:48
so what happens on these areas where
10:50
species interact on the use of the
10:53
resource is that over time
10:55
the fitness of those individuals start
10:57
reducing again as opposed to the
10:59
individuals where there is no
11:00
competition and all of the energy that
11:02
they had they allocated to reproduction
11:04
so what you'll start seeing
11:06
is that individuals start
11:09
coexisting by basically adapting to to
11:12
the resource this is what is called
11:13
resource specialization and over time
11:17
what you find again is a species
11:19
specializing on different spectrums of
11:21
the resource
11:22
so
11:24
one of the consequences of of this of
11:26
course is that the species can
11:27
specialize on certain areas by at times
11:30
increasing their abundances or their
11:32
body size as well again just trying to
11:34
optimize the use of a certain area of
11:37
their resource
Evidence
11:39
but what is the evidence though about a
11:42
competition driving body size so there
11:44
are actually we studied this for many
11:46
many decades one of the first papers
11:48
pointing out the significance of
11:50
competition body size was the work by
11:52
seoul
11:54
in 1966 what he did you guys can
11:56
appreciate this place here this is the
11:57
gulf of california
11:59
there are these tiny islands
12:01
inside the gulf that are very similar in
12:03
size and one of the things that he did
12:05
there was to to collect the number of
12:08
species and body size of lizards on
12:10
those islands and what he found is this
12:13
so when you see the body size the
12:15
average body size of the species on
12:17
those islands against the number of
12:19
species of lizards what you find is that
12:21
inverse relationship so basically when
12:23
you increase the number of species the
12:25
body size of the lizards become smaller
12:28
right so again this is one of the first
12:30
evidence to support the potential idea
12:31
that competition forces the species to
12:33
become smaller in that case for instance
12:36
here you have six species and you can
12:38
see the average body size of the species
12:40
is smaller than on islands where there
12:42
is only one species when the species
12:44
gets to be very large and again this is
12:46
one of the first pieces of evidence to
12:48
support the idea that ecological
12:50
interactions especially competition
12:52
among species makes the species become
12:55
smaller most likely again in their
12:57
effort to
12:58
specialize and survive from given places
13:00
they just
13:02
become a small
13:05
so in this case you will say that a
13:06
smaller is better or rather a smaller
13:08
force in the sense that is competition
13:11
what is forcing the species to become
13:13
smaller
Interactions
13:15
i want to clarify though that
13:16
competition is actually a very
13:18
interesting a complex and ecological
13:21
interaction among species and in fact
13:23
there are different ways that species
13:24
can interact with each other one of the
13:26
ways in which species compete is what is
13:29
called by interference
13:30
interference means
13:32
cases where a species can establish a
13:36
control over the use of a given resource
13:38
right those are resources again that can
13:40
be protected one example of that
13:43
is the territorial damselfish you you
13:46
ever go snorkeling in waikiki you
13:48
probably see these fish there and they
13:49
have these tiny gardens that they
13:51
monitor and basically what they do they
13:53
have these algae that they patrol and
13:54
they feed on in this case those tiny
13:57
patches can be protected the animal is
13:59
there sitting so any anybody that comes
14:01
around it just goes and attack and
14:03
that's the way that this species managed
14:05
to compete with other species and is
14:07
what is called interference right you
14:10
can think look at the key word this one
14:12
species interfering
14:14
with the use of the resource to other
14:16
species and again this happens in
14:18
resources that are limited and that can
14:20
be protected
14:22
i want you to think about giving this
14:24
interaction what will be the expected
14:26
body size of this species would you
14:28
expect those species to be large or
14:30
small especially
14:32
when it's competition by interference
14:34
when you have to protect a given place
14:37
from the use of the resource by other
14:39
species what would you think would be
14:40
the evolutionary output of body size
14:43
under these type of interactions
14:46
the other type of competition is what is
14:48
called by exploitation in this case you
14:50
have two or more species competing for
14:52
resources that cannot be protected an
14:54
example of this
14:58
is the the chromosome fish right so you
15:01
can see those fishes also in in
15:04
in waikiki and basically these are
15:06
species that you see them
15:08
on the column of the water eating there
15:11
in that case they feed upon plants that
15:13
is in the water so you can imagine then
15:15
that this plant just comes comes and
15:17
goes so it's very difficult for them to
15:19
protect that
15:20
resource so what they do here is compete
15:22
by exploitation basically anytime that
15:24
the food comes they gotta go and eat it
15:26
as fast as they can
15:28
that's what is called again competition
15:30
by exploitation and it normally happens
15:32
on resources that cannot be defended
15:34
especially
15:36
i want you to pause this video and think
15:38
about what would be the expected outcome
15:41
of body size under this type of a
15:43
competition by exploitation how will
15:45
competition by exploitation will check
15:47
the body size of these species will they
15:48
make them bigger or smaller think about
15:50
it
Taxon Cycle
15:52
another source of evidence
15:55
to support the significance of
15:56
competition on body size is what is
15:59
called the taxon cycle it's a as a
16:02
process introduced by joe wilson back in
16:04
1969 61 and what he suggests is that
16:07
normally what happens is that you have a
16:09
species on the continents colonizing
16:11
these islands once the species gets to
16:14
the island obviously their abundance is
16:16
low and their body size is large so
16:18
obviously the abundance is low because
16:19
nobody in the u.s managed to get there
16:21
and their body size is large because
16:22
obviously for them to be able to get
16:24
there only those ones that are big
16:26
managed to survive there because they
16:27
are the ones with the energy and
16:29
potential dispersal capabilities to
16:31
colonize those islands so generally
16:33
speaking the islands that normally
16:35
arrive the species or that normally
16:37
arrive on islands are low in abundance
16:40
and large body size but once they get to
16:42
that island they have no competition
16:44
whatsoever so what happens is their body
16:46
size reduces in benefit of increasing
16:49
their abundance
16:51
right now when the second species
16:53
arrives it's going to be exactly like
16:55
the first species arrive but it has a
16:57
competitive advantage because it's now
16:59
bigger so by that second species
17:01
arriving despite the fact that their
17:02
abundance was low but their boy's side
17:04
is bigger it will have an advantage over
17:06
the species that was already there that
17:08
became smaller and more abundant so the
17:10
queen's consequence of that is that the
17:12
species that arrived first will be great
17:14
user abundance because not have to fight
17:16
with second species that is more
17:17
competitive competitive has a larger
17:20
competitive advantage by being larger so
17:23
it will force the species that arrive
17:24
first not only a small in body size but
17:27
reduce their abundance while the other
17:29
species again given the advantage that
17:32
it has had it will reduce their body
17:34
size as well so
17:37
you can imagine this thing going um over
17:40
time replicating itself a transition
17:41
wise
17:42
some cycle so basically it's again the
17:45
survival of new species that are low in
17:47
abundance large in body size having a
17:49
competitive advantage that will force
17:51
other species to become smaller and less
17:53
abundant but because of that advantage
17:55
that they get they also will reduce
17:57
their their body size as well so that
17:59
type of tax on cycle will keep repeating
18:01
itself over time and it was a concept
18:03
introduced by joe wilson back in
18:06
61.
Climate
18:10
another force that will influence the
18:12
body size is climate so everything else
18:15
being the same one of the patterns that
18:17
you find very commonly almost on every
18:19
animal is that as you increase
18:21
temperature so is the amount of energy
18:23
that you require right you can see that
18:25
for instance on yourself when you get
18:26
hot you start sweating that's energy
18:28
that you are spending trying to maintain
18:30
that metabolism
18:31
so
18:32
obviously if everything else remains the
18:34
same
18:35
one of the consequences of you
18:37
increasing temperature right if the
18:39
results remain the same is that the body
18:41
size had to reduce right so imagine that
18:43
so you have to use more energy when it
18:45
gets hot
18:46
but if the amount of resources remain
18:48
the same then the species had no other
18:50
chance than becoming a smaller at times
18:53
they also become less abundant but here
18:55
since we are talking about body size
18:57
let's look at the first attribute there
18:59
is a paper
19:01
by a cherrydan and bigfour and here is a
19:03
yusuke's example on the reduction in
19:06
body size of a frog
19:08
between 1980s and 2008 and you can see
19:11
the huge reduction in body size of the
19:13
on these species the only explanation
19:16
for this is that the temperature got to
19:18
be too hot
19:19
in that same paper
19:21
they found that
19:23
in experiments that have been done
19:25
in the lab any time for instance that
19:27
you increase the temperature by two
19:29
degrees
19:30
in flies for instance what they find is
19:33
that the body size of the flyings will
19:35
reduce by three to seventy percent and
19:37
in fish again for the same two degrees
19:39
of warming fish normally reduce between
19:42
six and 22 percent and again that is
19:44
just a consequence of the species having
19:46
to maintain a larger metabolism when it
19:49
gets hot but the resources remain the
19:50
same something has to give up and in
19:52
that case it's body size
19:54
and that's how climate especially here
19:56
temperature influences the body size of
19:58
the species
20:00
there are also human factors that will
20:02
force the species to to adapt
20:05
in their body size and hunting is one of
20:07
them this is a pretty famous um and in
20:12
display done by flannery in his book in
20:14
1994 when he chose that for instance
20:16
many mammals on on australia in
20:19
australia have reduced significantly
20:21
their body size and basically one of the
20:24
things that happens that's over 40 000
20:26
years right and the only thing that you
20:28
can that can explain this massive
20:29
reduction in the body size of these
20:31
species is the fact that 40 000 years
20:34
ago was the time when humans first
20:36
colonized those places and the logic
20:38
says that when you get there and you
20:40
have the chance to eat from a huge pool
20:42
of spa individuals normally you will go
20:44
for the oils that are the largest
20:47
so this is kind of what
20:49
another impact of humanity which is
20:51
selecting over the fetus of all
20:53
individuals again we normally go for the
20:55
biggest one because that's the one that
20:56
we like the most over time that's going
20:58
to force the species again to modify
21:00
adapting since there is so much
21:02
mortality on the bigger ones the ones
21:04
that are smaller are having an advantage
21:06
and over time the consequence of this is
21:08
that the body size of the species will
21:09
become small
Fishing
21:12
fishing is another driver
21:15
now having a significant effect on the
21:17
body size of a species this is a very
21:19
famous paper by lauren mclanahan she was
21:21
a student from scripps and just for you
21:25
to know how easy is to produce
21:26
scientific papers she goes into a bar in
21:29
florida and in this bar that has been
21:31
around for many years there are
21:32
photographs of the fishing trips when
21:35
people come from their fishing trips
21:36
they take photographs of them and they
21:38
have been posting these photographs on a
21:40
wall so she saw this and she decided to
21:43
compile all of these photographs to see
21:45
the changes in body size all these
21:47
species over time and she has as a
21:49
result this paper that is super
21:51
influential in our field because it
21:53
shows with actual data that there was no
21:56
intention to collect it how the body
21:58
size of fish had reduced over time so
22:01
here you can see for instance
22:02
photographs of fish back in 1957. look
22:05
at the sizes of these fish man these
22:07
these were humongous including like
22:09
sharks here you can see a hammer chart
22:11
here
22:11
you can see how big they were look at
22:13
how small they were back in the 1980s
22:17
and how tiny they became by the 2007 so
22:20
right here you can see the significant
22:22
reduction in body size in the in the in
22:25
florida mostly as a consequence of us
22:27
fishing always the bigger fish
22:31
another example about the significance
22:33
of fishing on the body size is the cot
22:36
so here is for instance one car that was
22:38
caught
22:39
just this year and it measured about 121
22:42
centimeter and it was the world record
22:44
as the largest
22:46
fish of that species caught the reality
22:49
is that fish is only like about this
22:50
size the biggest one is about 30
22:52
centimeters and this one guy got one
22:54
that was 120 centimeters and today we
22:56
were so chuffed that he actually made it
22:58
to the bbc just to highlight the
23:00
significance of that large body size
23:02
however
23:04
it was this other guy jeremy jackson
23:06
that took a paleontological data to find
23:10
out how was the body size of these
23:11
species back in the day it turns out
23:13
that back in the day the romans when
23:14
they were fishing and going in their
23:16
expeditions in their boats they were
23:17
used to a stop by the beaches and had
23:20
their barbecues there when they leave
23:21
their barbecues they ate fish and
23:23
sometimes they left obviously the bones
23:25
and the bones of those fish now allows
23:27
you to calculate how big those fish were
23:30
so using that kind of data that that
23:32
allows you to figure out how big those
23:34
fish were jeremy jackson in com
23:36
in collaboration with other scientists
23:38
trace back how big this species was and
23:41
it turns out that this animal that today
23:43
is 120
23:45
120 is about four feet long we think
23:47
that is humongous turns out that that
23:49
was exactly the body size of that
23:51
species a thousand years ago so a
23:53
thousand years ago before the onset of
23:56
in navigation
23:58
the body size of the cod was 120
24:01
is 120 centimeters about four feet
24:05
um but by today the species is no longer
24:07
than 20 centimeters or about 18 inches
24:10
long so this is another example in which
24:12
it has been fishing what drove the body
24:14
size of this species and
24:16
smell evidence to suggest that fishing
24:19
indeed is reducing the body size of
24:22
species and having other consequences of
24:23
an ecosystem was introduced by this
24:26
professor david conover conover from
24:28
estonia brook
24:29
why did professor conover he took this
24:32
fish that reproduces relatively fast and
24:34
he took three aquariums right and on
24:36
those three aquariums he put the same
24:38
number of fish and in one of the
24:39
aquariums he took the smallest fish he
24:41
went and killed all of these mountains
24:43
in another aquarium he took fish
24:45
randomly and in another aquarium he
24:47
killed the biggest ones over three four
24:48
generations
24:50
what happens was that in the aquarium in
24:52
which he was killing the smallest fish
24:54
the fish became larger
24:56
it makes sense right so if there is a
24:58
selective pressure against a smaller
25:00
fish obviously those are dying the ones
25:03
that are bigger are having an advantage
25:04
they are going to survive so over time
25:06
they are going to become bigger
25:08
while the ones that
25:09
the ones that are killed large on those
25:11
populations the individuals the
25:13
population overall will become as small
25:16
so you are killing the big ones
25:18
the ones that survive are the smalls and
25:20
then there is no surprise that fishing
25:22
what it does it makes a species change
25:25
body size depending on who do we kill if
25:27
we kill the large ones the populations
25:29
will become small if we kill the small
25:31
ones the populations will become large
25:34
but if you remember the paper by jackson
25:37
by jeremy jackson what is happening in
25:39
nature is that the body size of the
25:41
species are becoming smaller which then
25:43
suggests that we are killing the largest
25:45
fish in the oceans
25:47
now the consequence of us killing the
25:49
bigger fish is the fact that the bigger
25:52
fish is related to how many and how big
25:54
your eggs and larvae are gonna be so
25:56
this is one of tons of papers that
25:58
document the size of the egg and the
26:01
larvae against the body size of the fish
26:03
and what you can see is that as you
26:04
increase the body size of a fish you
26:06
normally increase the mass again of the
26:08
eggs or the larvae and the benefit of
26:11
that
26:13
is that is larvae or the negative
26:15
effects sorry of you
26:17
killing the bigger fish leaving
26:19
populations based on a smaller fish is
26:21
then that the larvae are also going to
26:22
be a smaller and smaller larping
26:24
normally had a smaller survival
26:27
so the consequence of this or the
26:29
large the adults becoming smaller and
26:32
their osprey becoming also smaller is
26:34
that when you look at over popular over
26:37
exploitation
26:38
basically how much we are taking out of
26:41
a population normally what is happening
26:42
here is that the input of individuals is
26:45
smaller than the output we are killing
26:47
more
26:48
than what the individuals are being
26:50
added and then it's not that one of the
26:51
consequences of overexploitation is that
26:54
the populations will decline now
26:57
by us killing the bigger fish has an
27:00
additional consequence on the
27:01
populations getting smaller which is a
27:03
game that the larvae are gonna survive
27:06
less
27:06
and then you're gonna have even a
27:08
smaller input of individuals and this
27:10
causes what is called an essential
27:13
extinction vortex
27:15
so think about this so you are fishing
27:17
fish no matter what you are reducing the
27:19
population
27:20
but it turns out that the fish that you
27:21
are killing are the bigger fish that
27:23
then ended up having larvae their smile
27:26
that have your offspring a few if your
27:28
chances of surviving so
27:31
not only you had the population already
27:33
incapable of supplying the number of
27:35
fish that are being killed the ones that
27:37
are making it don't have the capacity to
27:39
survive so what happens on these cases
27:41
at times is what is called an extinction
27:43
vortex in which the populations are
27:46
taken to this point in which they will
27:47
drive themselves to extinction even if
27:49
we stop fishing again because we have
27:51
makes the the offspring so small that
27:54
they can just not survive on their own
27:56
and basically by you suppressing the
27:58
input of individuals you drive at times
28:01
species to extinction in what is called
28:03
an extinction vortex
28:05
let's summarize the class up to today so
28:08
when you look at body size and and find
28:10
out what are what is the factors that
28:12
determine the body size you obviously
28:14
had
28:15
resources the interactions like
28:17
predation and competition you had the
28:19
climate and then you had human-driven
28:21
evolution things related to hunting or
28:24
fishing
28:25
and that's gonna finish the class for
28:27
today in the next episode we will be
28:28
talking about some of the patterns in
28:30
=======

Intro
0:06
all right so today we're going to be
0:08
looking at body size but before i get
0:10
started with this class let's find out
0:12
how did we get here so we established
0:14
that
0:15
they were probably 4.6 billion years and
0:19
since planet earth was created then they
0:21
were about
0:22
1.1 billion years since we got our moon
0:25
and they were about after that time 4.6
0:28
billion years we had to wait about a
0:30
billion years for the first forms of
0:32
light to come which were called the
0:34
prokaryotes during the first billion
0:36
years in the history of the planet what
0:38
was cooking there was this thing called
0:40
the protocell again it's not really a
0:42
life form by itself but it was like a
0:45
plastic bag that allows molecules to be
0:47
contained and that kind of became the
0:49
precursor for you to get life once the
0:52
life came out
0:53
came out you get the prokaryotes
0:56
then from the prokaryotes we had to wait
0:58
a certain amount of time to get the
0:59
eukaryotes and next thing you know we
1:01
had a
1:03
8.7 8.9 million species that we are
1:06
sharing the planet with
1:07
all right now
1:09
however we also established though that
1:11
once the species originated via one of
1:13
four different pathways they started
1:15
spreading their distributions until they
1:18
get to an area that they will occupy for
1:20
a certain amount of time that area comes
1:22
to be called as the geographical range
1:25
one consequence of you having many
1:27
species overlapping their ranges is that
1:29
when you go and count how many species
1:30
are in a given place that leads you to
1:32
something that is called the pattern in
1:34
species richness
1:35
so
1:36
another attribute that will change those
1:38
you have many species living on
1:40
environments and adapting to those
1:41
environments and competing with them is
1:44
the fact that they they had to also
1:45
start modifying certain certain
1:48
characteristics of of
1:50
of the species one of them being body
1:52
size and the other attribute being
1:54
biomass
1:55
abundance
Energy Allocation
1:57
so
1:58
we already established that we just got
2:00
to be super lucky in our solar system by
2:03
having seven eight attributes that make
2:05
life possible in our planet one of those
2:07
attributes that is super important is
2:09
the amount of energy that we get from
2:10
the sun
2:11
so basically if you look at that energy
2:14
that comes from here right away that
2:16
energy gets converted by a species into
2:18
biomass and as you can appreciate right
2:20
here the amount of energy that we get is
2:23
going to change quite a lot from place
2:25
to place once the biomass is allocated
2:27
by the species then the species will
2:30
have to start again interacting with
2:32
them and that's going to start modifying
2:33
their body mass
2:35
their body mass and also their abundance
2:37
so one of the things that you will see
2:39
when you analyze these three attributes
2:40
of the species body size the richness of
2:43
the species or their abundance is that
2:45
commonly those three attributes in a
2:47
given community are highly correlated to
2:51
each other and again most commonly is
2:53
because depending on
2:55
the way that species allocate that
2:56
energy and how they optimize the use of
2:58
the energy of different places
Body Size
3:01
let's jump right away into body size so
3:03
obviously it's very clear for you right
3:05
now when you look at nature that
3:06
different species have different body
3:08
sizes for biogeographers it has been an
3:10
interesting question why why the species
3:13
do have the body science that they do
3:15
after years of analyzing this question
3:17
and collecting data they found that
3:20
when you look at the body size of a
3:21
given species it turns out that there
3:23
are several ecological and evolutionary
3:25
forces that a species had to deal with
3:28
so
3:29
well it turns out that depending on
3:31
these evolutionary and ecological forces
3:34
the body size is going to have a cost
3:36
right
3:37
but there is also going to be a benefit
3:39
to having that body size and basically
3:41
it's at this trade-off at this optimum
3:43
where the cause is equal to the benefit
3:46
that most likely will determine the body
3:48
size of the species think about it if
3:50
for some reason you are living in an
3:52
environment that has a huge
3:54
environmental cause for you to have a
3:55
large body size evolution is going to
3:57
start forcing you to have a smaller body
4:00
size the same thing goes places that
4:02
there may be an excess of energy or
4:04
perhaps little competition well in that
4:06
case there's a benefit for you there is
4:08
not going to be cause and there is a lot
4:10
of surplus of energy so most likely on
4:12
those places you are going to see body
4:13
size going up
4:15
so again
4:16
when you look at body size basically
4:19
what we are talking about is those
4:20
trade-offs between the costs and
4:21
benefits in relationship to ecological
4:24
and evolutionary forces and then what we
4:26
are going to be looking at today are
4:28
what are these forces equal from the
4:30
ecology and evolution that cause
4:33
trade-offs that will influence the body
4:35
size
Resources
4:37
obviously when you think about how big
4:39
you can be one of the first drivers that
4:41
you can think of is how much energy or
4:44
resources are available in one place
4:47
here is a very a
4:49
common pattern that is found in nature
4:51
basically when you look at the metabolic
4:53
rate which is the amount of energy that
4:55
is used by a species over time via
4:58
against the body size of that species
5:00
what you find
5:02
is that species that are large
5:04
a
5:05
normally used require a lot of energy so
5:08
they will need a lot of resources while
5:11
species that are small obviously they
5:12
don't use as much energy so the
5:14
resources that they need are smaller and
5:16
again this is a
5:18
pattern that is found throughout almost
5:21
everywhere in nature the bigger you are
5:24
the more energy you will need to sustain
5:26
that body
5:28
now then if you put
5:30
this in
5:32
pattern
5:33
into a given landscape in which the
5:36
amount of energy is going to change then
5:38
what you will find is that any time that
5:39
the resource are available reduces the
5:43
consequence of that is that the body
5:44
size will decrease right so again if
5:47
there is going to be
5:49
certain less energy required when you
5:51
are a small and the amount of energy
5:53
that is available is small that's going
5:55
to force you to become a smaller as well
5:58
the opposite is also true anytime that
6:00
the amount of resources increase then
6:03
obviously you can afford to have a large
6:05
body size and that is again kind of the
6:08
theory behind
6:09
the possibility that the amount of
6:11
resources or energy that is available in
6:13
one place is going to determine how big
6:14
the species are going to get on those
6:16
places however when it comes to the
6:19
to support inspiring there is not really
6:21
a lot this is one of the fewer papers
6:23
that you will find
6:25
about
6:26
the impact of the availability of
6:28
resources on body size so this is the
6:31
moment here the distribution of the
6:33
mammoth 41 000 years ago is shown here
6:35
in green red and yellow you can see that
6:38
the moment was distributed quite
6:40
extensively on the asia and europe
6:44
and by 2000 years ago
6:47
you should now start being patched
6:48
patchy and eventually wednesday 9500
6:51
years ago that's the time when the
6:53
mammoth went to stem now
6:55
that's one thing that we know very well
6:57
on the conti in the continent the
6:59
mammoth went to steam 9500 years ago but
7:02
then these guys came to find this tiny
7:05
this fossil of a mammoth on this island
7:09
called granger island one of the
7:11
interesting aspects of this discovery of
7:13
the mammal on that island is that the
7:15
individuals that were found there were
7:17
25
7:18
percent smaller than the individuals
7:20
that are found on the mainland and the
7:22
fossil shows that this individual
7:24
actually could have been there
7:26
7 000 to 5 000 years seven thousand to
7:29
four thousand years ago that means that
7:31
these animals managed to survive on this
7:33
island five thousand years after they
7:35
went in the continent now why is it
7:38
significant well it turns out that on
7:40
this island there were no humans there
7:42
were no glaciations during that time
7:44
frame suggesting that the reason why the
7:47
u.s got smaller was simply because there
7:50
was not enough resources on that island
7:52
to sustain such a large body size and
7:55
like the mammal that we saw on the
7:57
continent again this is a as you can see
8:00
that paper was polished in the urinal
8:02
nature and the significance of it is
8:03
that they despite the fact that it makes
8:05
a lot of sense
8:07
that the amount of resources will
8:08
influence your body size
8:10
evidence for it is very limited with
8:12
deception again on this one paper here
Predation
8:15
there are also ecological forces that
8:17
will that affect body size so when you
8:19
look at for instance predation which is
8:21
again an ecological interaction between
8:24
species you will have what is called a
8:26
predator something that eats something
8:28
and that something that is being eaten
8:29
is called the prey
8:31
it turns out that this ecological
8:33
interaction can influence body size as
8:35
well and it actually depends of where
8:38
that ecological interaction is happening
8:40
if the ecological interaction for
8:42
instance predation is happening on
8:44
places like coral reefs it has been
8:46
found that there
8:48
the the this the output the consequence
8:51
of predation is to make a species
8:53
especially the prey is smaller right so
8:56
you think about it you are on a reef
8:58
right ribs had a lot of small crevices
9:00
so you are to avoid the predator what
9:02
you really got to do is to become
9:04
smaller in body size so that you can
9:05
hide on those tiny crevices there so you
9:07
get to be big obviously the amount of
9:09
crevices that you find are smaller and
9:11
the higher the chance that you get eaten
9:13
so on coral reefs evolution has made
9:16
possible for predators to drive they
9:19
prey a smaller and then he follows then
9:21
that the predator also will have to
9:23
become a smaller just to be able to
9:24
sneak in and eat their prey
9:27
so again in coral reefs the most
9:30
common consequence of predation is to
9:32
make the prey and the predator smaller
9:34
now in open waters like when you go and
9:36
swim in the middle of the ocean it turns
9:39
out that on those cases the effect of
9:41
predation is actually to make the prey
9:43
bigger
9:44
right obviously you don't have a place
9:46
to hide there so what you gotta do is to
9:48
avoid being eaten by just not feeling
9:51
into the mouth of your predator so on
9:54
open waters the effect of predation is
9:57
for the prey and the predator to become
9:59
bigger
Competition
10:02
another ecological factor that also
10:04
influences
10:06
body size is competition so let's
10:08
imagine for instance for a moment here
10:11
this is the abundance of in if
10:13
individuals of a given species this is
10:14
the resource that is available in a
10:17
given place and let's imagine that you
10:18
have two species using that resource
10:20
right here the two species are in blue
10:23
are in red so as you can imagine here
10:25
what will happen then on this area of
10:27
the resource you had those two species
10:29
using the same resource if they had to
10:32
interact for the use of that resource
10:33
that means that they had to start
10:34
fighting and competing and wasting
10:36
energy defending the use of that
10:38
resource and the u.s are there obviously
10:41
are not as feet because the energy that
10:43
they could invest rather in offspring or
10:45
reproduction they are investing on
10:46
fighting against these other guys
10:48
so what happens on these areas where
10:50
species interact on the use of the
10:53
resource is that over time
10:55
the fitness of those individuals start
10:57
reducing again as opposed to the
10:59
individuals where there is no
11:00
competition and all of the energy that
11:02
they had they allocated to reproduction
11:04
so what you'll start seeing
11:06
is that individuals start
11:09
coexisting by basically adapting to to
11:12
the resource this is what is called
11:13
resource specialization and over time
11:17
what you find again is a species
11:19
specializing on different spectrums of
11:21
the resource
11:22
so
11:24
one of the consequences of of this of
11:26
course is that the species can
11:27
specialize on certain areas by at times
11:30
increasing their abundances or their
11:32
body size as well again just trying to
11:34
optimize the use of a certain area of
11:37
their resource
Evidence
11:39
but what is the evidence though about a
11:42
competition driving body size so there
11:44
are actually we studied this for many
11:46
many decades one of the first papers
11:48
pointing out the significance of
11:50
competition body size was the work by
11:52
seoul
11:54
in 1966 what he did you guys can
11:56
appreciate this place here this is the
11:57
gulf of california
11:59
there are these tiny islands
12:01
inside the gulf that are very similar in
12:03
size and one of the things that he did
12:05
there was to to collect the number of
12:08
species and body size of lizards on
12:10
those islands and what he found is this
12:13
so when you see the body size the
12:15
average body size of the species on
12:17
those islands against the number of
12:19
species of lizards what you find is that
12:21
inverse relationship so basically when
12:23
you increase the number of species the
12:25
body size of the lizards become smaller
12:28
right so again this is one of the first
12:30
evidence to support the potential idea
12:31
that competition forces the species to
12:33
become smaller in that case for instance
12:36
here you have six species and you can
12:38
see the average body size of the species
12:40
is smaller than on islands where there
12:42
is only one species when the species
12:44
gets to be very large and again this is
12:46
one of the first pieces of evidence to
12:48
support the idea that ecological
12:50
interactions especially competition
12:52
among species makes the species become
12:55
smaller most likely again in their
12:57
effort to
12:58
specialize and survive from given places
13:00
they just
13:02
become a small
13:05
so in this case you will say that a
13:06
smaller is better or rather a smaller
13:08
force in the sense that is competition
13:11
what is forcing the species to become
13:13
smaller
Interactions
13:15
i want to clarify though that
13:16
competition is actually a very
13:18
interesting a complex and ecological
13:21
interaction among species and in fact
13:23
there are different ways that species
13:24
can interact with each other one of the
13:26
ways in which species compete is what is
13:29
called by interference
13:30
interference means
13:32
cases where a species can establish a
13:36
control over the use of a given resource
13:38
right those are resources again that can
13:40
be protected one example of that
13:43
is the territorial damselfish you you
13:46
ever go snorkeling in waikiki you
13:48
probably see these fish there and they
13:49
have these tiny gardens that they
13:51
monitor and basically what they do they
13:53
have these algae that they patrol and
13:54
they feed on in this case those tiny
13:57
patches can be protected the animal is
13:59
there sitting so any anybody that comes
14:01
around it just goes and attack and
14:03
that's the way that this species managed
14:05
to compete with other species and is
14:07
what is called interference right you
14:10
can think look at the key word this one
14:12
species interfering
14:14
with the use of the resource to other
14:16
species and again this happens in
14:18
resources that are limited and that can
14:20
be protected
14:22
i want you to think about giving this
14:24
interaction what will be the expected
14:26
body size of this species would you
14:28
expect those species to be large or
14:30
small especially
14:32
when it's competition by interference
14:34
when you have to protect a given place
14:37
from the use of the resource by other
14:39
species what would you think would be
14:40
the evolutionary output of body size
14:43
under these type of interactions
14:46
the other type of competition is what is
14:48
called by exploitation in this case you
14:50
have two or more species competing for
14:52
resources that cannot be protected an
14:54
example of this
14:58
is the the chromosome fish right so you
15:01
can see those fishes also in in
15:04
in waikiki and basically these are
15:06
species that you see them
15:08
on the column of the water eating there
15:11
in that case they feed upon plants that
15:13
is in the water so you can imagine then
15:15
that this plant just comes comes and
15:17
goes so it's very difficult for them to
15:19
protect that
15:20
resource so what they do here is compete
15:22
by exploitation basically anytime that
15:24
the food comes they gotta go and eat it
15:26
as fast as they can
15:28
that's what is called again competition
15:30
by exploitation and it normally happens
15:32
on resources that cannot be defended
15:34
especially
15:36
i want you to pause this video and think
15:38
about what would be the expected outcome
15:41
of body size under this type of a
15:43
competition by exploitation how will
15:45
competition by exploitation will check
15:47
the body size of these species will they
15:48
make them bigger or smaller think about
15:50
it
Taxon Cycle
15:52
another source of evidence
15:55
to support the significance of
15:56
competition on body size is what is
15:59
called the taxon cycle it's a as a
16:02
process introduced by joe wilson back in
16:04
1969 61 and what he suggests is that
16:07
normally what happens is that you have a
16:09
species on the continents colonizing
16:11
these islands once the species gets to
16:14
the island obviously their abundance is
16:16
low and their body size is large so
16:18
obviously the abundance is low because
16:19
nobody in the u.s managed to get there
16:21
and their body size is large because
16:22
obviously for them to be able to get
16:24
there only those ones that are big
16:26
managed to survive there because they
16:27
are the ones with the energy and
16:29
potential dispersal capabilities to
16:31
colonize those islands so generally
16:33
speaking the islands that normally
16:35
arrive the species or that normally
16:37
arrive on islands are low in abundance
16:40
and large body size but once they get to
16:42
that island they have no competition
16:44
whatsoever so what happens is their body
16:46
size reduces in benefit of increasing
16:49
their abundance
16:51
right now when the second species
16:53
arrives it's going to be exactly like
16:55
the first species arrive but it has a
16:57
competitive advantage because it's now
16:59
bigger so by that second species
17:01
arriving despite the fact that their
17:02
abundance was low but their boy's side
17:04
is bigger it will have an advantage over
17:06
the species that was already there that
17:08
became smaller and more abundant so the
17:10
queen's consequence of that is that the
17:12
species that arrived first will be great
17:14
user abundance because not have to fight
17:16
with second species that is more
17:17
competitive competitive has a larger
17:20
competitive advantage by being larger so
17:23
it will force the species that arrive
17:24
first not only a small in body size but
17:27
reduce their abundance while the other
17:29
species again given the advantage that
17:32
it has had it will reduce their body
17:34
size as well so
17:37
you can imagine this thing going um over
17:40
time replicating itself a transition
17:41
wise
17:42
some cycle so basically it's again the
17:45
survival of new species that are low in
17:47
abundance large in body size having a
17:49
competitive advantage that will force
17:51
other species to become smaller and less
17:53
abundant but because of that advantage
17:55
that they get they also will reduce
17:57
their their body size as well so that
17:59
type of tax on cycle will keep repeating
18:01
itself over time and it was a concept
18:03
introduced by joe wilson back in
18:06
61.
Climate
18:10
another force that will influence the
18:12
body size is climate so everything else
18:15
being the same one of the patterns that
18:17
you find very commonly almost on every
18:19
animal is that as you increase
18:21
temperature so is the amount of energy
18:23
that you require right you can see that
18:25
for instance on yourself when you get
18:26
hot you start sweating that's energy
18:28
that you are spending trying to maintain
18:30
that metabolism
18:31
so
18:32
obviously if everything else remains the
18:34
same
18:35
one of the consequences of you
18:37
increasing temperature right if the
18:39
results remain the same is that the body
18:41
size had to reduce right so imagine that
18:43
so you have to use more energy when it
18:45
gets hot
18:46
but if the amount of resources remain
18:48
the same then the species had no other
18:50
chance than becoming a smaller at times
18:53
they also become less abundant but here
18:55
since we are talking about body size
18:57
let's look at the first attribute there
18:59
is a paper
19:01
by a cherrydan and bigfour and here is a
19:03
yusuke's example on the reduction in
19:06
body size of a frog
19:08
between 1980s and 2008 and you can see
19:11
the huge reduction in body size of the
19:13
on these species the only explanation
19:16
for this is that the temperature got to
19:18
be too hot
19:19
in that same paper
19:21
they found that
19:23
in experiments that have been done
19:25
in the lab any time for instance that
19:27
you increase the temperature by two
19:29
degrees
19:30
in flies for instance what they find is
19:33
that the body size of the flyings will
19:35
reduce by three to seventy percent and
19:37
in fish again for the same two degrees
19:39
of warming fish normally reduce between
19:42
six and 22 percent and again that is
19:44
just a consequence of the species having
19:46
to maintain a larger metabolism when it
19:49
gets hot but the resources remain the
19:50
same something has to give up and in
19:52
that case it's body size
19:54
and that's how climate especially here
19:56
temperature influences the body size of
19:58
the species
20:00
there are also human factors that will
20:02
force the species to to adapt
20:05
in their body size and hunting is one of
20:07
them this is a pretty famous um and in
20:12
display done by flannery in his book in
20:14
1994 when he chose that for instance
20:16
many mammals on on australia in
20:19
australia have reduced significantly
20:21
their body size and basically one of the
20:24
things that happens that's over 40 000
20:26
years right and the only thing that you
20:28
can that can explain this massive
20:29
reduction in the body size of these
20:31
species is the fact that 40 000 years
20:34
ago was the time when humans first
20:36
colonized those places and the logic
20:38
says that when you get there and you
20:40
have the chance to eat from a huge pool
20:42
of spa individuals normally you will go
20:44
for the oils that are the largest
20:47
so this is kind of what
20:49
another impact of humanity which is
20:51
selecting over the fetus of all
20:53
individuals again we normally go for the
20:55
biggest one because that's the one that
20:56
we like the most over time that's going
20:58
to force the species again to modify
21:00
adapting since there is so much
21:02
mortality on the bigger ones the ones
21:04
that are smaller are having an advantage
21:06
and over time the consequence of this is
21:08
that the body size of the species will
21:09
become small
Fishing
21:12
fishing is another driver
21:15
now having a significant effect on the
21:17
body size of a species this is a very
21:19
famous paper by lauren mclanahan she was
21:21
a student from scripps and just for you
21:25
to know how easy is to produce
21:26
scientific papers she goes into a bar in
21:29
florida and in this bar that has been
21:31
around for many years there are
21:32
photographs of the fishing trips when
21:35
people come from their fishing trips
21:36
they take photographs of them and they
21:38
have been posting these photographs on a
21:40
wall so she saw this and she decided to
21:43
compile all of these photographs to see
21:45
the changes in body size all these
21:47
species over time and she has as a
21:49
result this paper that is super
21:51
influential in our field because it
21:53
shows with actual data that there was no
21:56
intention to collect it how the body
21:58
size of fish had reduced over time so
22:01
here you can see for instance
22:02
photographs of fish back in 1957. look
22:05
at the sizes of these fish man these
22:07
these were humongous including like
22:09
sharks here you can see a hammer chart
22:11
here
22:11
you can see how big they were look at
22:13
how small they were back in the 1980s
22:17
and how tiny they became by the 2007 so
22:20
right here you can see the significant
22:22
reduction in body size in the in the in
22:25
florida mostly as a consequence of us
22:27
fishing always the bigger fish
22:31
another example about the significance
22:33
of fishing on the body size is the cot
22:36
so here is for instance one car that was
22:38
caught
22:39
just this year and it measured about 121
22:42
centimeter and it was the world record
22:44
as the largest
22:46
fish of that species caught the reality
22:49
is that fish is only like about this
22:50
size the biggest one is about 30
22:52
centimeters and this one guy got one
22:54
that was 120 centimeters and today we
22:56
were so chuffed that he actually made it
22:58
to the bbc just to highlight the
23:00
significance of that large body size
23:02
however
23:04
it was this other guy jeremy jackson
23:06
that took a paleontological data to find
23:10
out how was the body size of these
23:11
species back in the day it turns out
23:13
that back in the day the romans when
23:14
they were fishing and going in their
23:16
expeditions in their boats they were
23:17
used to a stop by the beaches and had
23:20
their barbecues there when they leave
23:21
their barbecues they ate fish and
23:23
sometimes they left obviously the bones
23:25
and the bones of those fish now allows
23:27
you to calculate how big those fish were
23:30
so using that kind of data that that
23:32
allows you to figure out how big those
23:34
fish were jeremy jackson in com
23:36
in collaboration with other scientists
23:38
trace back how big this species was and
23:41
it turns out that this animal that today
23:43
is 120
23:45
120 is about four feet long we think
23:47
that is humongous turns out that that
23:49
was exactly the body size of that
23:51
species a thousand years ago so a
23:53
thousand years ago before the onset of
23:56
in navigation
23:58
the body size of the cod was 120
24:01
is 120 centimeters about four feet
24:05
um but by today the species is no longer
24:07
than 20 centimeters or about 18 inches
24:10
long so this is another example in which
24:12
it has been fishing what drove the body
24:14
size of this species and
24:16
smell evidence to suggest that fishing
24:19
indeed is reducing the body size of
24:22
species and having other consequences of
24:23
an ecosystem was introduced by this
24:26
professor david conover conover from
24:28
estonia brook
24:29
why did professor conover he took this
24:32
fish that reproduces relatively fast and
24:34
he took three aquariums right and on
24:36
those three aquariums he put the same
24:38
number of fish and in one of the
24:39
aquariums he took the smallest fish he
24:41
went and killed all of these mountains
24:43
in another aquarium he took fish
24:45
randomly and in another aquarium he
24:47
killed the biggest ones over three four
24:48
generations
24:50
what happens was that in the aquarium in
24:52
which he was killing the smallest fish
24:54
the fish became larger
24:56
it makes sense right so if there is a
24:58
selective pressure against a smaller
25:00
fish obviously those are dying the ones
25:03
that are bigger are having an advantage
25:04
they are going to survive so over time
25:06
they are going to become bigger
25:08
while the ones that
25:09
the ones that are killed large on those
25:11
populations the individuals the
25:13
population overall will become as small
25:16
so you are killing the big ones
25:18
the ones that survive are the smalls and
25:20
then there is no surprise that fishing
25:22
what it does it makes a species change
25:25
body size depending on who do we kill if
25:27
we kill the large ones the populations
25:29
will become small if we kill the small
25:31
ones the populations will become large
25:34
but if you remember the paper by jackson
25:37
by jeremy jackson what is happening in
25:39
nature is that the body size of the
25:41
species are becoming smaller which then
25:43
suggests that we are killing the largest
25:45
fish in the oceans
25:47
now the consequence of us killing the
25:49
bigger fish is the fact that the bigger
25:52
fish is related to how many and how big
25:54
your eggs and larvae are gonna be so
25:56
this is one of tons of papers that
25:58
document the size of the egg and the
26:01
larvae against the body size of the fish
26:03
and what you can see is that as you
26:04
increase the body size of a fish you
26:06
normally increase the mass again of the
26:08
eggs or the larvae and the benefit of
26:11
that
26:13
is that is larvae or the negative
26:15
effects sorry of you
26:17
killing the bigger fish leaving
26:19
populations based on a smaller fish is
26:21
then that the larvae are also going to
26:22
be a smaller and smaller larping
26:24
normally had a smaller survival
26:27
so the consequence of this or the
26:29
large the adults becoming smaller and
26:32
their osprey becoming also smaller is
26:34
that when you look at over popular over
26:37
exploitation
26:38
basically how much we are taking out of
26:41
a population normally what is happening
26:42
here is that the input of individuals is
26:45
smaller than the output we are killing
26:47
more
26:48
than what the individuals are being
26:50
added and then it's not that one of the
26:51
consequences of overexploitation is that
26:54
the populations will decline now
26:57
by us killing the bigger fish has an
27:00
additional consequence on the
27:01
populations getting smaller which is a
27:03
game that the larvae are gonna survive
27:06
less
27:06
and then you're gonna have even a
27:08
smaller input of individuals and this
27:10
causes what is called an essential
27:13
extinction vortex
27:15
so think about this so you are fishing
27:17
fish no matter what you are reducing the
27:19
population
27:20
but it turns out that the fish that you
27:21
are killing are the bigger fish that
27:23
then ended up having larvae their smile
27:26
that have your offspring a few if your
27:28
chances of surviving so
27:31
not only you had the population already
27:33
incapable of supplying the number of
27:35
fish that are being killed the ones that
27:37
are making it don't have the capacity to
27:39
survive so what happens on these cases
27:41
at times is what is called an extinction
27:43
vortex in which the populations are
27:46
taken to this point in which they will
27:47
drive themselves to extinction even if
27:49
we stop fishing again because we have
27:51
makes the the offspring so small that
27:54
they can just not survive on their own
27:56
and basically by you suppressing the
27:58
input of individuals you drive at times
28:01
species to extinction in what is called
28:03
an extinction vortex
28:05
let's summarize the class up to today so
28:08
when you look at body size and and find
28:10
out what are what is the factors that
28:12
determine the body size you obviously
28:14
had
28:15
resources the interactions like
28:17
predation and competition you had the
28:19
climate and then you had human-driven
28:21
evolution things related to hunting or
28:24
fishing
28:25
and that's gonna finish the class for
28:27
today in the next episode we will be
28:28
talking about some of the patterns in
