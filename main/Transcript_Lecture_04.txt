
0:06
so today we're going to be looking at
0:08
the evolution of one clay that we know
0:10
relatively very well humans and what i
0:13
want us to do is to look at that clay as
0:15
an example on how a species evolve
0:18
into multiple things and that evolution
0:20
is something that is happening not only
0:22
through time but also through a space
0:24
and when you get many species doing
0:26
exactly the same thing what you interact
0:27
with is this overlap on the ranges of a
0:30
species that then results in these
0:32
patterns that are the focus of
0:34
biogeography
0:36
so let's just review very quickly though
0:39
uh something that i mentioned earlier
0:41
about how do you go from one species to
0:42
another to two others which is called a
0:45
speciation i made a mistake in the last
0:47
lecture to say that there were three
0:49
processes when there are clearly four of
0:50
them four different mechanisms in which
0:52
you go from one species to the other
0:55
from one species to two and we define
0:57
them as allopatric speciation basically
0:59
what happens in these mechanisms you get
1:01
a barrier the populations get separated
1:04
as a result of this separation these
1:05
populations will try to adapt and if
1:08
that separation happens for enough time
1:10
if those populations were to come upon
1:11
counter again they will not reproduce as
1:13
a result you go from one species to
1:15
another to two via allopatric speciation
1:19
peripatric and parapatric speciation are
1:21
relatively similar versions of a
1:23
speciation in which you get a population
1:25
that is established to the periphery of
1:28
the ancestral population in the case of
1:30
peripatric speciation
1:32
the population that is created on the
1:34
periphery is completely isolated but in
1:36
parapatria there is still some
1:37
connectivity the end of these two
1:39
pathways again is that you end up having
1:41
two species at the end and then finally
1:44
we have sympathetic speciation in which
1:46
you go from one to two
1:47
species that process happening exactly
1:50
in the same place
1:53
now when we talk about a speciation
1:54
though how do you go from one species to
1:56
another
1:57
to two the key question that is how fast
2:00
that process happened darwin
2:02
originally suggested that that process
2:04
of going from one to two was a gradual
2:06
process it's something that happens over
2:08
very long uh evolutionary timing skills
2:12
in something that he defines as gradual
2:14
adaptation model however that was kind
2:16
of puzzled though in the sense that
2:18
there were no really a lot of fossils to
2:21
document that entire progression or
2:24
you're going from one species to the two
2:26
to two
2:27
according to the gradual adaptation goal
2:29
you will expect to see some very
2:31
nice transitions from these one species
2:33
to two and that should be
2:35
reflected in the
2:37
fossil record however
2:39
those intermediate states were not
2:42
available
2:44
dagwin speculated that
2:47
they were there they were just we just
2:49
haven't found them or perhaps many of
2:51
them were already lost but darwin
2:53
suggested that you go from one to two
2:56
via this gradual progression on the
2:58
process of evolution
3:00
however in 1972 an alternative idea was
3:03
suggested which is the fact that that
3:05
these changes from one species to the
3:07
other to two our process are
3:10
are things that happen very quickly in
3:12
something that is called punctuated
3:13
equilibrium model and it was introduced
3:15
by these two guys here niles eldridge
3:18
and and go
3:20
and they suggest it's not that the
3:21
fossils are not there is that those
3:23
fossils don't exist at all basically you
3:25
go from one species to two to two via a
3:29
very fast evolution
3:31
unfortunately well there was this other
3:33
guy rich at that games that kind of
3:35
challenged the idea of the future
3:37
equilibrium and these guys went at each
3:39
other for many years actually this
3:41
debate lasted for several decades and at
3:43
the end of the day we kind of settled to
3:45
believe that the two mechanisms of
3:47
speciation are correct there are times
3:50
in which you are going to have the
3:52
conditions and the taxa that allows for
3:55
a
3:56
process of
3:58
a speciation that is gradual what in
4:00
other cases you might got you might have
4:04
fast environmental changes as an example
4:06
that could lead to very fast evolution
4:08
of a species so
4:10
again despite the fact that it was at
4:12
the and it still is not resolved today
4:14
rather believe that
4:16
whether you get a gradual or punctuated
4:19
a model of a speciation is a function of
4:21
the tax that you are studying
4:24
now let's look at now
4:27
and
4:27
again a case example of this process of
4:30
speciation in on us humans so there is
4:34
obviously according to darwin we all
4:36
come from a common ancestor and we're
4:38
still debating what that common ancestor
4:40
is for us however when you start
4:41
building the human phylogeny
4:44
you find that there were several
4:45
milestones that were important again for
4:48
us to diversify or to differentiate
4:50
ourselves from our ancestors like for
4:53
instance one key
4:55
milestone in revolution was that we
4:58
started to walk and that happened about
5:00
606 million years ago the evidence
5:03
that we had to suggest that we kind of
5:05
went from force from line that sitting
5:07
or walking on four feet to two is this
5:09
guy here is a fossil that was discovered
5:12
in 2001 in africa
5:15
that
5:16
fossil was described in a paper in the
5:19
journal nature that right there is a
5:21
nature you're gonna see through this as
5:23
i describe the human philosophy how
5:25
every fossil that has been discovered as
5:28
it relates to us has been published
5:30
normally in journals like nation and
5:31
science which are the top journals in
5:33
the world again just to highlight the
5:34
significance of those discoveries
5:36
because every time that one of those
5:38
fossils is discovered normally what
5:40
happens is that we change the way that
5:42
we know our own history so you are going
5:45
to see very common how these milestones
5:48
that allows to define or actual
5:49
phylogeny are actually published
5:51
commonly on very high profile journals
5:52
in this case mostly it's just lucky
5:54
discoveries of these people
5:57
another interesting discovery was in
6:00
this fossil over here in 1995 a paper
6:03
a fossil that was discovered in africa
6:05
in 1995 again in kenya and again the
6:08
paper no surprise got published in the
6:10
urinal nature that now is very strong
6:13
evidence but that by 4.1 million years
6:16
ago we were already standing in two legs
6:18
and obviously the significance of us
6:20
standing in two legs is that now i allow
6:22
us to run faster maybe we were being
6:24
chased by an animal and it allows us to
6:27
do a lot of different things and that
6:29
kind of talk or evolutionary pathway in
6:31
a completely different way of how we
6:32
were before
6:34
now 2.6 billion years
6:37
ago it was the dawn of technology that's
6:39
the first areas now that humans have
6:42
started to use tools and you can imagine
6:44
the significance of this milestone in
6:45
our in our evolutionary history when now
6:48
we can get access uh
6:51
beyond our
6:52
own organs and body to to do things you
6:55
know so that turned out to be a huge
6:58
milestone 2.6 million years ago when we
7:00
started to use tools
7:02
then
7:05
888.8 million years ago we had this guy
7:08
here the control of fire that was huge
7:11
for us to get control over fire that
7:14
kind of sells apart from every species
7:16
that we know in the world one of the
7:17
significant things of having control
7:20
over fire is that obviously it will
7:22
allow us to have to be safe it will
7:24
allow us to
7:26
be safe at night
7:28
critically though the control of fire
7:30
what it gave us is the control the
7:32
capacity to cook you might not think
7:34
much about cooking but it turns out that
7:36
having control over fire now give us
7:38
access to a complete different set of
7:41
diets
7:42
now we could eat food
7:45
that we can digest faster and in fact
7:47
one of the interesting modifications in
7:49
the human body as a result of us having
7:51
control over fire was the fact that or
7:53
instance became shorter
7:56
so that is interesting and again now we
7:58
don't have to spend too much time
7:59
foraging and
8:01
be to find food or to process the food
8:03
when we can easily now get access to
8:05
quick food so that this one was huge
8:09
another interesting transformation in
8:12
our body
8:13
around the same time was the fact that
8:15
our brain became bigger and that
8:16
obviously gave us a huge competitive
8:18
advantage compared to many other species
8:20
there is still a huge debate about why
8:23
our brain got to be so big
8:25
so one speculation is the fact that now
8:28
we with us having access to different
8:31
types of diets we had more energy to
8:33
fuel that humongous brain that we were
8:36
to have now although that hypothesis is
8:39
controversial although some evidence
8:40
suggests very strongly that that's the
8:43
the reason for why we had such a big
8:45
brain that we now have the capacity to
8:47
process food faster
8:50
and finally about ten thousand years ago
8:53
we domesticated plants and animals and
8:55
that led us to who we are today homo
8:58
sapiens again a species that was
9:00
described but the first species that was
9:02
ever described according to daily nail
9:04
system in
9:05
1956 and we got to be everywhere so that
9:08
generally speaks about the milestones in
9:11
our evolution however
9:14
there have been several interesting
9:16
discoveries through time right like for
9:19
instance this discovery about
9:21
about a species called lucy that species
9:24
was discovered in 1974 and it was
9:26
published in the journal nature science
9:28
in 79 and it suggests that perhaps there
9:31
is a completely different
9:35
lineage for for the evolution of humans
9:37
so it turns out that humans we we kind
9:40
of branch out earlier on evolution and
9:42
there was another group of
9:43
species that look like us that branch in
9:45
a completely different pathway so this
9:48
this one fossil kind of broke into the
9:51
phylogeny of humans and the name of the
9:53
fossil is called lucy you all that guy
9:56
that name is actually pretty famous in
9:57
the fossil record
9:59
another interesting discovery
10:03
in the
10:05
philology of human is that perhaps there
10:06
was a different ancestor for on a
10:09
pathway across our philogenia was this
10:12
guy here calastro lopiste cos sebida
10:14
that was discovered actually very
10:15
recently in 2010 it was found in south
10:18
africa he made it to science and not
10:20
only in the science but he got the cover
10:22
of a science and again the significance
10:24
of this one finding here is the fact
10:27
that it led to a completely different
10:28
ancestor
10:31
perhaps another another cool discovery
10:33
is this one guy here called ardy this is
10:35
a fossil again that was discovered not
10:38
too long ago in 2009 that suggests that
10:41
the origins of the
10:43
of the
10:44
branch that led to humans to humans is
10:46
perhaps much earlier than that when
10:48
that what we talked earlier
10:51
this was a discovery that made it all
10:53
over the news around the world
10:57
another
10:58
interesting discovery is this guy here
11:01
ida
11:02
this discovery is a fossil that was
11:05
published in 2009 and it's super
11:07
interesting because this one species was
11:10
framed somebody bought the proposal put
11:12
it on a house and it was framed there
11:15
for many years until somebody came along
11:16
and saw it and it realized that this was
11:19
actually the missing link so when you
11:21
look at the whole evolution of humans we
11:24
are still missing that fossil that will
11:26
attach us to the arrest of evolution of
11:28
a species in the in the world and that's
11:29
what is called the the missing link and
11:31
you see movies about that and it's used
11:33
by the by religion to suggest that
11:36
we are different from all other species
11:38
because there was not a fossil that was
11:40
able to attach our pathway of evolution
11:42
to the byway of evolution of all other
11:44
species this discovery turned out to be
11:47
massive because this is the missing link
11:49
now that was able to collect this to
11:51
connect this branch of evolution of us
11:55
to to the evolution of all other species
11:58
the name of this guy was called ida
12:00
there is a very cool article about ida
12:04
in youtube and i i recommend you to have
12:06
a look at it because i find it
12:08
mind-blowing that this one guy
12:10
was again standing on the wall of
12:12
somebody being framed until somebody saw
12:14
it once i discovered the significance of
12:17
this fossil the fossil was sold for a
12:19
million dollars can you imagine that
12:21
thing you having a frame on your house
12:23
that is worth a million dollars and you
12:25
didn't even know again going back to my
12:27
original class about this thing of
12:28
critical observation you know like you
12:30
get to know how important things are
12:34
again as i point out there is a very
12:36
interesting
12:37
video about this in youtube so
12:40
i recommend you to have a look at it
12:43
about ida
12:45
now another thing that is pretty cool
12:47
about the human evolution and something
12:49
that that it teaches about the evolution
12:52
of already species is this thing that we
12:54
talked earlier about a hybridization
12:57
when you had species that had diverged
13:00
over time they come together the issue
13:02
with hybridization though is that the
13:04
offspring of hybrids don't are not
13:06
viable so they cannot reproduce a
13:08
different business is when lineages that
13:10
are completely different moving
13:12
different pathways when they reproduce
13:14
and their offsprings are viable that is
13:16
what is called admixture basically when
13:19
previously diverging or isolated genetic
13:21
lineages mix
13:22
humans are actually
13:24
pretty crazy about this i mean the
13:27
ancestors of us were used to have wild
13:29
parties so to speak because it has been
13:32
discovered that we actually interpret a
13:35
lot with
13:36
different species of
13:41
different species along our lineages
13:43
like for instance this one here this is
13:45
the famous other tunnels
13:47
and there is some genetic evidence to
13:49
suggest that we actually if you are
13:50
white like me
13:52
white or asian it's very likely that in
13:54
your genes today we have genes of the
13:56
nerd and those so it turns out that back
13:59
in the day when the when the people
14:01
when humans left first africa they
14:04
encountered any articles and they
14:06
reproduced with them via this process of
14:08
mixture so a lot of genetic similarity
14:11
between the genes of the articles and a
14:14
people that is located in the lower
14:15
parts of asia some genes found on
14:19
of people that is also from europe
14:22
however there is no similarity between
14:24
the genetic makeup of the inner argentos
14:27
and people from africa which allow them
14:29
to conclude that this
14:30
mixture these
14:32
these guys having sex did happen after
14:35
we left africa for the first time
14:38
another example of us having wild
14:40
parties back in the day it's related to
14:42
those guys here these are called
14:44
that
14:45
denisova this is another lineage on the
14:47
in the evolution of mankind and it turns
14:49
out that
14:50
we also had some genes the people from
14:53
that
14:54
part of asia had some genes in relation
14:57
to that species
14:58
again just for you to realize that it's
15:00
not always clear cut once we branch out
15:03
in evolution
15:05
that we become separated there are
15:07
several case examples in which we can
15:08
come together and in fact we can produce
15:12
us planes that are viable in that case
15:14
that will become a make sure if the
15:16
offsprings are not viable that will be
15:17
called hybridization
15:21
now that is over time right what i just
15:23
showed you here this is evolution over
15:25
time but one of the things that are is
15:27
missing in filogen is is the space where
15:29
it is happening in space right so here i
15:31
just give you an example of the
15:33
migrations of these different lineages
15:35
and how they sometimes came together and
15:36
has exact
15:38
and
15:39
make admixture there but
15:41
but this evolution
15:44
also happens in a space not only time
15:47
but in space as the species are
15:49
originated one of the things that they
15:51
all do is they disperse and they
15:53
colonize new places so let's look at us
15:56
or movements so it turns out there is
15:58
this thing called the genographic
15:59
project is a fascinating project you can
16:02
see the infographics of it in national
16:04
geographic basically what they did here
16:07
they taught the genetic
16:09
samples of people not the populations
16:11
for everywhere around the world today
16:13
and as i explained to you earlier what
16:15
they did
16:17
in this case they look at the genetic
16:18
similarities among those populations and
16:20
as a result they didn't know didn't know
16:23
only created the phylogeny but they
16:26
managed to match the pathways in which
16:28
these populations went from one place to
16:30
another and they created again what is
16:32
called the genographic project it's a
16:34
fascinated fascinating project
16:36
describing the way that we left africa
16:38
so let me just describe to you
16:41
some interesting pathways of how we get
16:44
to be where we are there is this species
16:46
called april group l0
16:49
it's about a hundred thousand years old
16:51
and basically it's a genotype uh
16:54
that was created in africa and i made
16:56
really no worse but towards the
17:01
west right there is another hoploth
17:03
apple type this one here is about 80 000
17:06
years old these guys again come from
17:09
around the same place but they they move
17:11
towards a
17:13
in
17:15
arabia
17:16
and that's a prototype then led to the
17:19
movement these people that moving along
17:21
this pathway left to a completely
17:22
different haplotype that is called
17:23
applogroup and that is about 60 000
17:26
years old that colonized all of the
17:28
lower parts of the in lowering the
17:30
pacific and lower indian ocean and this
17:33
april group of course made it all the
17:35
way up to australia
17:38
now
17:39
you will think that it was only one way
17:41
that we got out of africa it turns out
17:43
that thanks to this project we
17:44
discovered that there were actually
17:45
several times that we moved out of
17:47
africa and the evidence is this other
17:49
guy which is a much younger
17:51
apple group that
17:53
came and moved in
17:55
that got out of africa and those guys
17:58
actually
17:58
um diverse along two different pathways
18:02
there
18:03
then we have this april group and
18:06
f the the h of that upload group is not
18:09
very well known but this this is the one
18:12
that ended up colonizing all of the
18:13
asian
18:16
islands in the pacific
18:18
we had this other apple group here we
18:20
just don't know these are the ones that
18:21
led to people like most likely like
18:23
people like you or me the ones that
18:25
colonize the the power of europe that
18:28
ended up then moving to the united
18:30
states and
18:33
south america many centuries later
18:37
there is this other group haplogroup a
18:40
is about 50 000 years old these guys
18:42
colonized in the northern parts of
18:44
europe
18:45
this way this one here another
18:46
colonization of euro 35 000 years
18:50
ago these ones decided to move up north
18:53
in asia and all of the siberian park 15
18:55
years old these are the guys now that
18:57
start getting closer to the americans
18:59
and eventually
19:01
it got to a point where about 10 000
19:04
years ago they finally crossed into the
19:06
americas and it turns out that they were
19:09
again different pathways different times
19:11
that we actually were able to cross and
19:13
through the americans and there when you
19:15
look at the
19:16
genetic makeup of native
19:19
human populations in the americas it
19:22
turns out that they are two different
19:24
haplogroups in in this
19:26
continent suggesting again that there
19:28
were at least two different times that
19:30
we crossed from asia into into the
19:33
americas and that now describes to you
19:36
how we went from one place to another
19:38
and the other thing that i wanted to
19:39
show here with these images is the
19:41
beauty of the genetic makeup of of
19:44
people
19:45
was saying species trying to evolve or
19:48
to adapt to specific environments and
19:50
you can imagine over time if we were not
19:53
able to cross to each other these these
19:55
different apple groups eventually
19:57
turning into different species in the
19:58
case of humans of course what happens we
20:01
are is that you can imagine the degree
20:03
of the capacity of us to migrate you can
20:07
see this thing over 100 000 years we
20:09
pretty much managed to just walk because
20:11
back in the day there was no way for us
20:13
to move but basically we should walk
20:15
an entire continent and actually
20:17
colonize another one so in the case of
20:19
humans that capacity to disperse
20:22
kind of reduces the capacity of us
20:25
turning into completely different
20:26
species but if we didn't have
20:29
that capacity to disperse it's very
20:30
likely that the adaptation that results
20:33
in these different phenotypes that you
20:35
see here will over time lead to
20:36
completely different species
20:39
let me show you a couple other apple
20:41
groups that i find very interesting
20:43
again on the patterns of migration there
20:44
is this apple group about 50 000 years
20:46
old again originated in the in the upper
20:49
part of in
20:52
india the indian ocean
20:55
and i migrated all the way up to south
20:57
america this is the other apple group
20:59
that i that i like very much i was used
21:01
to live in australia back in the day and
21:03
it is interesting to see the pathway of
21:05
migration that led to the people that
21:07
colonize in
21:09
australia and then this sane apple group
21:12
actually colonized a lot of the
21:14
continent all of the islands that were
21:16
close to the continent along the along
21:18
asia and eventually via that pathway
21:21
obviously you can imagine these people
21:22
being very capable of navigation and
21:24
things like that obviously they were
21:26
easily capable of migrating into the
21:28
americas and was one of the the upper
21:31
groups that we see represented in the
21:33
genotypes of populations along the
21:36
americas
21:38
of course there was a point in time in
21:40
which just we just managed to be
21:41
everywhere this is a satellite image of
21:44
the world at night and basically what
21:45
you can see here is that today in this
21:48
map you can see where we are and you can
21:50
see that we are pretty much everywhere
21:51
in the planet with the exception of the
21:53
oceans but pretty much anywhere in the
21:54
planet where we can be
21:56
we are already there here is another
21:58
example again of the craziness of the
22:00
state to which we managed to colonize
22:03
the world
22:05
obviously our population also got to be
22:07
very abundant not only we managed to to
22:10
go to places but we also
22:14
managed to increase in abundance and
22:16
here you can see the increase in the
22:18
number of people right you can see like
22:19
look for thousands of years of
22:21
population was very small and just in
22:24
the last in thousand years we went from
22:27
being like less than 1 billion to now
22:29
having a nearly 7 billion and we could
22:32
potentially easily reach 12 billion
22:34
people
22:35
and by the end of the 2050s
22:38
just as a reference for you and
22:42
in this decade that just passed
22:44
we went from seven billion people
22:46
in 2011 which was a
22:49
1 billion people more than was there 10
22:52
years ago prior to that year so what i
22:55
am what i point out there is that in
22:57
less than in a little bit more than 10
23:00
years the world's human population
23:02
increased by a billion people
23:04
pretty much you see the history of
23:06
humanity not in the first 10 000 years
23:10
we reached 1 billion and in the last
23:13
decade we increased 1 billion in just 10
23:15
years
23:17
now
23:18
now that i just explained to you this
23:20
this
23:21
phylogeny or this evolution of of
23:23
humanity and how the species originate
23:26
they move and as they move they are that
23:29
and they come back you can imagine the
23:31
the mess that this creates as it comes
23:33
down to a species because that was just
23:35
one but imagine a lot of species doing
23:37
that so what you ended up with is
23:39
something like this where every one of
23:41
these
23:42
polygons that you see here is the
23:44
pattern of despair the movements of one
23:46
species the geographical range where
23:48
species is have is present and now you
23:50
can imagine hundreds of species doing
23:53
that simultaneously so you can imagine
23:55
the diversity of opportunities that this
23:58
offers for a species to add and to
24:00
diversify
24:02
so that evolution that we had discovered
24:04
and that it was in
24:06
that we had described and that was
24:08
discovered by darwin is something that
24:10
happens both in space and time is
24:12
happening for many species and of course
24:15
the overlap of those in individual cases
24:18
results in patterns that then are the
24:20
focus of
24:22
the study of biogeography and later on
24:24
we're going to start looking at again
24:26
these patterns but what i want you to to
24:28
realize in advance when we start looking
24:30
at these patterns is the fact that those
24:33
patterns are again the result of
24:35
evolution
24:36
[Music]
24:37
of individual species
24:39
happening in space and time that
24:41
basically coincide with many other
24:43
species so that's what i want you to
24:45
stay the angle that you that i want you
24:47
to start looking at when we start
24:48
looking at those patterns later on
24:51
that's the class for today and i see you
24:53
guys in the next episode
