
Introduction
0:05
go welcome welcome to biogeography 309 let me introduce myself my name is camilo
0:11
mora i'm originally from colombia i did an undergrad at a university in colombia a phd at a
0:18
university in canada a postdoc at a university in new zealand a postdoc at a university in california and a postdoc
0:25
at the university of the house in canada for the last 11 years i have been a
0:31
professor here at the university of hawaii my lab has published over 80 scientific
0:37
publications 12 of those papers have been in journals like nature and science
0:42
out of the millions of papers that are published every year three times we have been among the top
0:48
100 most influential papers in 2011 2013 2017
0:53
the papers that we have published have been highlighted in the new york times and washington post 12 times we have been also in cnn time magazine you name
1:00
it i'm going to be your professor of biogeography this year all right that's it about me let me get
1:06
started i'm going to be taking the first few classes of this course to introduce
1:11
several terms that you need to know so that later on you can better appreciate some of the content that we're going to
1:16
be describing later on so the first two classes bear with me we're going to be
1:21
looking about different terms probably not related to each other but i need you to get those terms before we get
1:27
moving forward let's start with what is biogeography the specific definition of biogeography
What is Biogeography
1:33
that you will find in any textbook is this one that appears here basically the study or the distribution of species and
1:39
ecosystems in geographic space and through geological time generally speaking is basically just understanding
1:45
the distribution of a species in space and time let's get down let's go back though to
Characteristics of Life
1:52
the beginning to understand what we are studying which is life the diversity of life let's start by looking at the
1:58
characteristics that are required for there to be life so a scientist had already come up with a list of bibles
2:04
that require for life the first one is this one we need to have a constant and stable source of energy in the case
2:11
of the solar system for us that source of energy is the sun there are two important key words here that you need
2:17
to keep in mind one is constant in the sense that we need a source of energy to to remain constant over time
2:24
because if it keeps changing oxidating quite a lot then that's going to create a problem for life to to evolve
2:31
the second one is stable again the that being said life requires time
2:38
to evolve and diversify so during that time again we need that source of energy to
2:44
be stable we can again try we need to ensure that that source of energy doesn't change quite a lot that's the
2:50
reason again why this is the attribute one of the most important attributes for there to be life the source of energy
2:56
needs to be constant and stable the second attribute that has been identified as important for life is that
3:02
we need to we need to have a terrestrial planet there are many planets in the universe that are made out of gas
3:07
unfortunately on those planets life is not possible we need to have a sustain in which we can settle down for light to
3:13
evolve that's the second most important attribute the third attribute that is obviously very obvious in our
3:20
solar system is this this one related to how far are we from the
3:26
solar from the source of energy obviously we are too close it's gonna get too hot and if we
3:32
are too far it's gonna be too cold so we need to be in that sweet spot
3:37
in which we are not too far nor too close or that source of energy for life to to evolve
3:43
we need to have a satellite start in the case of us that satellite start is the moon and the moon actually plays
3:49
multiple roles in the capacity of life to emerge and evolve and one that i'm
3:55
going to point out here is the capacity to stabilize the axis of rotational translation of our planet we can have
4:01
that moon the satellite star or planet will be just spiraling out of control
4:06
and then so that satellite star the moon kind of makes things settle down a
4:11
little bit as well there are many layers many other attributes that make that satellite star important for life but
4:17
that's just one attribute that i wanted to mention to you the other attribute that is important
4:22
is we need to have a an orbit that in which we move around the source of energy that needs to be nearly circular
4:28
it cannot be circular because if it is circular that means that there is no variation so by us
4:34
having a wave to move around the sun that looks more like an ellipse we create variability in the case of our
4:40
planet that will be the winters and the summers and that creates enough variability that then allows life to
4:45
emerge and diversify we need to be in the right place in the galaxy scientists have come to discover
4:52
that there are multiple bad actors in the universe like for instance black holes you know i mean
4:57
places in the universe that in which there is such a strong gravitational force that anything that gets closer to
5:03
those places gets sucked into has been calculated for instance that if we were
5:08
anytime close to one of those black holes the size of the entire planet earth will be
5:14
reduced to uh to the size of a sugar cube just for you to realize
5:19
how bad it could be if we were closer to some of those places in the universe so again there is a prime state so to speak
5:27
in which we need to be located in comparison to other places in the universe
5:32
finally we need carbon and oxygen obviously life cannot happen only once
5:39
the the the the sweet thing about life is that it can perpetuate over time for that we
5:45
need to have a way to replicate the information over time and in our case that is possible thanks to carbon carbon
5:52
again is a is a an element that allows to a life to create molecules that can be
5:59
replicated and perpetually over time the only important element for life is that when they're
6:04
oxygen so for for a multitude of reasons the diversity of life on the planet have
6:11
moved down this pathway in which the metabolism that allows the energy to be
6:17
processed at the individual level requires that oxygen so just as here at the level of individuals we need
6:23
energy to operate the the individual in cell via that metabolism that will require oxygen we
6:29
also need an air source of energy at the larger scale and
6:34
we need also a magnetic shield the idea of the magnetic field is that you have a
6:39
lot of different types of energy produced by this source of energy by these a main source of energy that blast
6:46
or planet earth so thanks to the the existence of these magnetic fields some of these damaging
6:53
waves that come from the sun can be diverted and as a result life can
6:59
prosper so if we didn't have that magnetic shield that would not be life at all in our planet earth just for you
7:04
to know that magnetic field is possible thanks to the movement of
7:09
very hot materials in the core of the planet so these materials are super hot in the core and they move up to the
7:16
surface and this moving up and down creates a magnetism that again can translate to this magnetic shield that
7:22
then allow us to to expel this and rays that come from from the
7:27
from from the sun and right here you have the the main attributes that make life possible
7:33
now what i want to do is to contextualize the significance and how rare those
7:39
attributes are so you look at the entire universe it has been calculated that could easily be on the order of 100
7:45
billion planets that look like our of planet earth 100 billion yet when you look at all of them these
7:51
characteristics that i just mentioned to you only about 10 of those planets are believed to have those characteristics okay just for you to understand
7:58
not only the the importance of those attributes but the combination of those attributes so rare that only 10 planets are likely
8:05
to have those characteristics what it means though is that the probability of us finding another planet like ours is
8:11
one in one billion one in one billion use for you to understand what that means i want you to
8:16
think about this think about whether you have won the national lottery or whether you know a person that has won the national lottery at least once it turns
8:23
out that back in the day a student told me that he won the national lottery once and he kind of ruined my analogy but
8:28
just to for you to understand within the national law that it has a probability of one in 200 million one in one billion
8:36
is like we need a national lottery five times in a row right and again you don't
8:41
know a single person that has won the national lottery ones where the chances that we're gonna find a person that will win the national lottery five times it's
8:48
gonna be almost impossible and that again is for me to contextualize the significance of what we had in our
8:54
planet a very unique set of conditions that have made life possible and as far as we know there is just no other planet
9:01
that will have them in addition obviously a lot of
Biodiversity and Money
9:06
people they don't care about that kind of stuff a lot of people don't care about species if we do care the majority
9:12
of people will care about the species and also many of them will go extinct but one thing that most people care about is money so here i'm going to give
9:19
you another reason for why those species that we share the planet with are important
9:24
so there is this guy called constanza and what he did he took multiple attributes that come from biodiversity
9:30
that are important like air water food recreation and medicine and he managed to calculate the amount of money that is
9:36
produced on every one of these attributes by ecosystems and the magic number came to 33 trillion dollars what
9:42
i want you to realize is that in the united states for instance we may have a huge deal out of a deficit on the order
9:48
of 16 trillion dollars that have been accumulated for 20 years and we are kind of
9:54
making a huge deal out of it when biodiversity produces twice that in every single year and again for you to
10:01
understand the economic value that we had on biodiversity another thing that you should understand is that
10:07
it doesn't really matter how big facebook or twitter or instagram get to be at the end of the day humanity
10:13
doesn't feed on those things we feed on these species we breed the air that is produced by those species for you to
10:18
realize that at the most basic level humanity is sustained thanks to those species as well so again going into why
10:25
biodiversity is important unfortunately humanity we're destroying biodiversity
Why biodiversity is important
10:33
it's not very rare to see ecosystems that look like this converted into ecosystems that look like that and as
10:39
scientists we have discovered that there are many things that lead to that destruction like having the laws of exploitation climate change and today we
10:46
are we we're in this habit to criticize the people in africa and the amazon you
10:51
hear commonly those savages in the amazon destroying the the forest there when in reality what i want you to do is
10:58
look outside your window and see what is there and you most likely are going to see buildings and roads and cars well it
11:04
turns out that back in the day there was a forest there and in that forest there were a lot of species all of those species are already gone so we don't
11:11
really have a moral argument today in the developed world to criticize people in the developing world when they are
11:16
doing what we already did so this transformation is not something
11:23
exclusive to a single place in the planet and father almost everywhere in the world that you have people the same pattern
11:30
has always been the same we go to those places we denuded the land of whatever is there so that we can hire houses or
11:35
roads or infrastructure and the land to eat food and things like that so this transformation is very well documented
11:43
one of the big no-nos about presentations is never put a lot of words on a slide i'm gonna violate my
11:50
own rule here just for me to identify to highlight to you the amount of information already out there
11:56
documenting this transformation of ecosystems for instance there is a paper here by bell harper showing that 100 of
12:02
the world's oceans are already impacted by human activities so you take a satellite image of the entire planet and
12:08
look at the oceans it turns out that there is not a single pixel that is unknown is not already impacted by
12:14
humanity there is this other paper by sanderson looking at land the same analysis
12:19
looking at how humanity has impacted different places on the land and he found that 83 of the land is impacted by
12:26
humanity by humans directly the only places that we have not impacted at the north and south pole and mostly just
12:32
because we cannot live there and later on was identified that climate change is actually one of the main drivers of
12:38
change there so despite the fact that we don't live directly on those places now we are impacting them thanks to climate
12:44
change so this analysis by sanderson had to be reviewed because in his paper
12:50
he didn't analyze the impacts of climate change but it's still quite mind-blowing already that in any place
12:55
where we can leave humans 83 of the of the land has already been impacted we're losing the order of 6 million hectares
13:02
think about this 6 to 20 million hectares of forests are cut every single year
13:08
14 billion trees being cut per year as well for every one of us somewhere around the world somebody's cutting two
13:14
trees global mangroves we lost three million hectares in 20 years sea grasses we lose 110 kilometers a year the
13:22
caribbean coral reefs of all of the coral reefs in the caribbean we already lost 80 percent of those coral reefs
13:27
here the paper by myers and bodies warm showing that all of the fishes in the ocean those big fishes we already lost
13:34
90 percent of them of all of the biggest fishes charged tunas you name it 90 percent of those species already gone
13:40
the world's fisheries won by gone by 2048 a paper by boris one year and i can
13:45
pretty much spend hours pointing out you to use scientific papers documenting this massive transformation of
13:52
ecosystems basically all of these beautiful species that would share the planet with completely gone now
13:58
now unfortunately scientists have also come to discover that this transformation will be forever so how we
14:04
had this idea that once once we care we're going to go and fix this equals this destruction of ecosystems well it
14:11
turns out that reversing this strength might not be possible once we push these ecosystems to the brick for them to come
14:17
back it's very difficult the reason for this is what is called alternative equilibrium states
14:24
basically what happens is this you have a species and that species is adapted to a given ecosystem right like i am a bird
14:30
i like living here in hawaii i had the perfect temperature it turns out that if you have something that comes under
14:36
stress this species like for instance you make it too hot for me as a result me as a bird i gotta find a place where
14:42
to go and basically what i try to do is to adapt to this new environment when
14:48
i adapt to this new environment basically what happens is that me as a species we lose a lot of genes
14:54
once those genes are gone those genes are not coming back and again that's one of the things that makes this decline of
15:01
biodiversity concerning in the sense that it's going to be very hard for us to recover
15:06
the ecosystems that have lost a lot of genes and there are all other mechanisms that i'm going to point out at the end
15:12
of this class in which once we push the populations to the break it turns out that a species rather than recovering
15:19
if we stop the stress or the species by themselves go to extinction for instance when you take populations to a very low
15:26
level then the goals that are left are so far apart that they don't find each other as a result they cannot reproduce
15:31
so even if sometimes we care and we stop these species of being destroyed sometimes the species will go extinct by
15:38
themselves because in this case if they don't find each other that's normally what is called aliyah fed or deposiation
15:45
there is also this issue related to the genetic bottlenecks basically when you leave populations with soft individuals
15:52
you end up reproducing close relatives and that leads to the in green depression basically the
15:59
the genes are deleterious popping up more
16:04
commonly unfortunately with this transformation of ecosystems one of the things another
16:10
thing that is happening is that ecosystems from around the world are losing the capacity to provide basic
16:16
things that you and i need goods and services and unfortunately that's translated into a decline in human
16:22
welfare social scientists will tell you that the reason why you have hunger in many places around the world is because
16:28
there is no inequity in the use of resources there is no transport of food and water and things
16:35
like that but what i want you to realize is that at the most basic level the reason why people are going hungry on
16:41
certain places is because the places where they live have been destroyed in the capacity to produce what the people
16:47
need in the first place so anytime that you think about again people going hungry think about the fact that the
16:53
language they live has been depleted the capacity to produce the food and water that those people need unfortunately the
17:00
statistics are staggering today it has been estimated that around the world a billion people one billion
17:07
of us go hungry every day now another a person on average that is
17:13
every second think about that man in one minute around the world 60 people die because
17:20
they have insufficient food to to survive and a child under the age of 5
17:25
every 5 seconds as a direct of poor nutrition when it comes down to water there are a billion people in the planet
17:32
living on places where there is an incapacity of those ecosystems to provide basic water to to these people
17:37
so you can get a picture of really what we are doing to ourselves by us destroying nature
17:44
unfortunately humanity is in a completely it's in a completely unsustainable path and you can hear that
17:50
and some people speaks about this and you can potentially see the fact that species are going to stain and that
17:56
people go hungry those alone are already some indications that we are in an unsustainable pack what i'm gonna use
18:02
here though is to give you some numbers for you to realize how unsustainable we are so here this is a paper that i published
18:09
with my supervisor peter cell many years ago what i did here i took the number of people over time
18:15
so by 2020 they were on the order of seven billion people in the planet but here i projected the number of people up
18:21
to the year 2015. now what i do next i multiply the number
18:27
of people by the amount of land that is required to sustain a human being well it turns out
18:33
that the minimum amount of land that you need to live well is 2.1 hectares
18:39
obviously today there is a huge disparity in the amount of land that is used to sustain the energy demands of
18:46
the people from around the world on one stream you have people in saudi arabia a person in saudi arabia uses the land of
18:52
12 hectares and a people in the united states people in the united states uses the
18:57
productivity of night hectares just think about the fact that a single individual in the united states uses the
19:03
land that is sufficient to feed four people anywhere else in the world
19:08
obviously those are conditions that are wasteful we waste obviously too much energy there but on the other stream you
19:14
have the places that don't use enough energy and for instance here an example is haiti in which the average person in
19:20
haiti consumes 0.7 hectares of land obviously the protein in haiti is the
19:25
fact that a lot of people go hungry there so you don't really want to live in those conditions the magic number the
19:31
sweet number is 2.1 hectares again that today is the minimum amount of land that
19:36
a single individual in the world requires to live well now let's do a quick mathematics yes let's
19:42
round the number of people at seven billion and the amount of land required per person to two hectares so seven
19:49
billion people times two hectares that gives you 14 billion hectares now you take a satellite image of the plant of
19:56
the planet and calculate the amount of land that is available you will find that there are 11 billion hectares so
20:01
that alone already tells you that humanity today is consuming three million hectares
20:07
three billion hectares more than what the planet can produce now
20:12
in this paper one thing that i did there with my supervisor was an interesting calculation to calculate
20:19
humanity's consumption in terms of planet earth right so basically again i multiply the number
20:25
of people by the area that they require and divide that by the total area available and that gives you
20:31
humanity's consumption in terms of planet earth and here what i allow you what it allows you to do is to calculate
20:37
this figure here when we calculated an ecological human ecological demand and it's
20:43
calculated in terms of planet earth so what you see from this plot is that it was back in the 1980s when humanity
20:50
the size of the world human population was large enough to be kept sustainably
20:56
over time right in the 1980s is when the number of people was large enough for
21:02
the planet earth to sustain that people at 2.1 hectares after that unfortunately the number of people start going beyond
21:09
what the planet can sustain and that led to what we call a status of overshot as i point out to you today we are
21:15
consuming 3 billion hectares more than what the planet can produce so an extension that i did on this paper
21:21
was then to calculate the cumulative overshot over time and that allowed me to calculate this figure here in which
21:27
we showed that by 2050 almost regardless of the scenario there is going to be an
21:33
ecological deficit of 25 planet earth think about that 2050 is going to be a
21:38
crazy time for humanity when over time or unsustainable use of nature leads to to
21:46
an ecological debt that will require the planet 50 planets to pay so again when we talk
21:53
about unsustainable this is the mathematics that i want you to keep in mind the fact that even today
22:01
we are using more than what the planet can produce and that is very obvious on the fact that you get a lot of people going
22:07
hungry and a lot of species going to stain so that alone is an indication of of what is why is it that we are so
22:13
sustainable but these are the mathematics that i would like you to use when you are asked the question where we are sustainable or not
How do we maintain biodiversity
22:21
now again continuing with why is it that biodiversity is important biogeography
22:28
is important one key question that you will see on most sciences is
22:34
how do we maintain biodiversity well it turns out that for you to protect for you to maintain biodiversity we need to
22:40
propose solutions that will protect biodiversity unfortunately for you to to propose solutions how are we going to
22:47
protect nature you need to have some prior understanding that will ensure that this is effective right one of the
22:54
first pieces of knowledge that you need to have is to understand the causality of the threats by this
23:01
i mean to identify the specific factors that are leading to the transformation
23:06
of biodiversity the reason why this is important is because then it will allow you to identify what is it that we are
23:12
going to protect let's say for instance that biodiversity is declining because of overfishing but there is a
23:18
possibility that it will also be declining because of climate change so as scientists we need to resolve who is
23:24
it that is causing the loss of a species is it overfishing or habitat loss or is climate change so as scientists we need
23:30
to be able to resolve this again so that we can be more specific on exactly is it and exactly what is it that we need to
23:36
stop to say biodiversity the other reason why this piece of knowledge is important
23:43
is because whatever you say people is not going to go easy on it the reason being that there are a lot of people that is going
23:49
to be impacted by the decision that we propose for instance if we say that is climate change what is the driving
23:56
species well it's going to be a lot of people that is going to be impacted by this for the united states for instance
24:01
it has been calculated that it could be easily 4 40 400 billion dollars that
24:06
will cause us to address the issues of climate change somebody has to pay for this it's not going to be cheap so a lot
24:12
of people is going to oppose heavily in solutions on climate change if it is
24:18
fisheries fisheries is 5.7 billion dollars a year so again we say the oceans are
24:25
being declining are declining because of overfishing we need to stop over fishing well there is going to be a ton of
24:31
people that is going to tell you no we are not going to do this because the economy of many countries and many people around the world depends on it if
24:38
we say it's pollution well as a case example here that for the florida keys it costs 4 million dollars a year just
24:43
to ensure that the water that is dumping to the oceans is good in there so again you you get the
24:49
sense here on the of why is it that it's important for us to understand why what is driving biodiversity so that
24:58
whoever is impacted and accept that information and this
25:04
obviously is going to increase compliance on whatever protection we suggest to protect biodiversity
25:10
the webpiece of knowledge that is important again if you want to maintain biodiversity is to understand because
25:15
the the the drivers of biodiversity by this i mean what is leading
25:22
to a species to be more abundant in some places than other the reason why this is important is
25:28
because today there is a huge economic deficit on on the implementation of these
25:33
protections so for instance if we think about protected areas today protected areas are working on only one third of
25:40
the money that they need to be effective so there is a huge economic deficit on all all of these conservation pro
25:46
protection and solutions countries don't have the money so the
25:52
protection of biodiversity is something that gets very little money so when we figure out exactly what is it that is
25:58
driving biodiversity one thing that we can do then is to prioritize
26:03
these very limited resources on the places that we know are going to be the most effective to protect biodiversity
26:09
and eventually we can suggest that those are the places that need to be protected so that we can ensure that biodiversity
26:15
is maintained over time now again if the ultimate purpose is to
26:20
protect biodiversity what i want you to understand is that we need to understand what is driving biodiversity
26:27
here and also what are the impacts of humanity on that biodiversity and these two pieces of knowledge are at the core
26:33
of biogeography and you guys through this class are gonna we're gonna be focusing a lot on
26:38
understanding these two different things and again there are this is at the core of biodiver biogeography and i want you
26:45
to understand how is it that we contextualize but you guys are gonna be learning in this class as it relates to
26:50
the protection of a species
26:56
now with that being said though i'm going to move on now to give you some feedback on how is it that biogeography
27:02
research is done all right so we're going to be diving in into a lot of scientific papers on biogeography but
27:09
what i want to do in this first class is to give you a sense on how biogeography research is done so whenever i introduce
27:15
later on papers and things like that you can figure out how is it that a scientist is going to make those conclusions
Pattern vs Process
27:22
so when you think about geography really all what it is is this distinction between the pattern and the process
27:29
generally speaking a pattern is defined as the variation or lack thereof in the spatial or temporal distribution of
27:35
things right so here are some examples of different patterns so here i have a pattern that is uniform here is a
27:41
pattern that is random and here i have a pattern that is cluster so those are patterns again
27:49
variations in the distribution of things in space and time those are generally what is defined as partisan biogeography
27:55
now another important aspect of biogeography is the process and the process is basically the mechanism that
28:01
causes the pattern in biogeography you will find several patterns that have been identified
28:07
already we're going to be going through some of them in this class but there are tons of processes obviously
28:14
humanity we're very curious and we try we like challenging information so well there are a lot of patterns that have
28:20
been very well defined as it comes down to the processes we're still trying to figure out why things are the way they
28:25
are and there are new ideas emerging all the time so how scientists do this well
How Scientists Do This
28:32
everything starts with you having an interest observation and obviously uh
28:38
an interesting question a pattern that you observe in nature then you go and obtain the data then you build a pattern
28:44
then you test hypotheses to explain this pattern that's kind of the scientific approach that we had in biogeography to
28:50
produce research on biogeography now let's let's narrow down on specific
28:57
attributes here let's start again with what is it what you are that you are interested on and this specific thing we are
29:03
interested in the system the system could be as simple things as for instance trees ants butterflies lizards
29:12
fish you name it so you can be interested on any of these different
29:18
groups and now within the given system then you are going to be looking at attributes and several attributes can
29:24
include things like the number of species the body size or the abundance of the species that are there so again
29:29
that refers here at this at the top while you are trying to figure out what is it that you
29:35
are going to do and exactly how you need to narrow it down again to assistant and then to an attribute that you want to
29:40
obtain the data there are different ways to obtain data in biogeography one method that is
29:46
commonly used is the transit all what it is is basically you take a tape you put a tray tape on the ground and a certain
29:53
distance on both sides of that tape you either count the species the body size or the abundances or the species that
29:58
are there another method that is commonly used is called the point count in this method all what it is you stand
30:05
up on a given place and you count the attribute that you want to measure within a certain radius of the place
30:11
where you are sitting there does the point come the only one method that is commonly used is called the quadrat and the
30:17
quadratic what it is is just a piece of pvc that you put on the ground and normally you had a grid on that pc and
30:23
what you do is to count whatever your one account on that speed on that specific quadrant
30:28
so every one of these methods to collect data is obviously applied to the given
30:34
system that you want to study like if for instance you are studying wells you are not going to be using a quadratic
30:40
it's very likely that a whale is going to pass by your quadrant in the case of studying wells most likely you're going
30:45
to be using something similar or related to point counts there
30:50
now once i obtained the data i had to build a pattern let me just give you an example of how to build this
30:56
pattern so let's take an example here let's imagine that this is my transit and i i went to that transient and i
31:02
come one species and this point i come to a species and i just keep going along my transit counting how many species are
31:08
there then i joined the points and that's your pattern right there so if you observe this line that emerged here
31:13
you can already tell right away that there is a pattern here there is a high number of species on this place and it
31:19
reduces on both sides as you move away so that is in one dimension you can also
31:25
do the same kind of pattern on species richness now in in grids this is an example here in which we actually build
31:31
the number of species in two dimensions this is the number of species in the entire united states
31:36
you can also be patterns on body sizes here for instance it's an example in which somebody collected
31:42
then the body size of a species and basically what you do is count the number of species at different body
31:47
sizes so those are again examples of different patterns that you can build in biogeography
31:54
now once you build a pattern you have to go and collect data to test different hypotheses to explain that pattern there
32:01
is a diversity of bibles that you can use the internet and today humanity with access to the information there are tons
32:07
of variables that you can use here are some examples you can look at for instance the number of people protect the areas temperature hero games you
32:14
name it basically what you try to do then is to establish if there is any relationship between the pattern that
32:21
you found and the different bibles that you analyze sometimes you get lucky and you find that there is one single bible
32:26
that explains the entire pattern then you go and write your paper and if you are lucky enough and your paper is
32:32
interesting it might get picked up by the news and you are probably gonna be happy for about a month right during
32:37
that month you are going to be the happiest person in the world knowing that you publish an interesting scientific paper and made an interesting
32:43
discovery but i'm telling you in advance you are not going to last happy very long because most likely what will
32:48
happen is that a scientists are going to be are going to start reading your paper and they're they're going to start questioning what you found and what it
32:56
happens most commonly is that you have to go then back and reassess new hypotheses or new ways to analyze the
33:03
data and that again creates this vicious loop
33:08
in which we are today which is again trying to refine our understanding of the patterns and
33:14
processes on biodiversity and that kind of defines here the the general process on how we produce information on
33:21
biogeography let me give you some examples of patterns in
Examples of Patterns
33:26
general biogeography this one on the specie richness the part of species regions the latitudinal gradient of
33:32
species richness is a pattern that is common to many taxa and basically what it is is that when you look at a
33:38
latitudinal gradient from the norpole to the south pole and you count the species that you move along you find that most
33:44
of the species are always located in this in this tropics right
33:50
now as it comes down to why is that's the case why is it the most especially in the tropics there is a paper by
33:55
willie that took all of the scientific papers providing explanations for this pattern and he found that there are 32
34:01
explanations already again just what i explained earlier well sometimes patterns are easy to identify
34:08
the process is a lot more complicated here is another pattern that is commonly known this is the latitudinal
34:15
gradient and body size it's also times at times referred as berman's rule so you take a latitudinal gradient like i
34:21
show here from the north pole to the south pole and on the coast of the pacific coast of the americas what you
34:27
will find is that at higher latitudes you have animals being larger than what they are in the
34:33
tropics right that's what is called berman's rule and is this relationship between
34:39
the size the body size of a species and the temperature and normally what that results in is you having species that
34:46
are much larger at higher latitudes than species that live in the tropics as it comes down to why that's the case well
34:52
it turns out that it could be a combination of the amount of energy that is required to sustain that body the
34:58
amount of energy that is available on those places and the capacity of that body size to maintain that energy we are
35:05
going to be covering that at the end of this class during this class later on another pattern that is interesting as
35:11
well that we are going to be covering in this class is the pattern of abundance again the same deal if we do a
35:17
latitudinal gradient along the pacific coast of the americas what you will find is that most of the species that live in
35:23
the tropics are abundant as we establish they are small in body size but when it comes down to
35:29
their abundances they are actually quite abundant there the explanation for this pattern could
35:35
be again a combination between the energy requirements of the individual the amount the amount of energy
35:40
available and the histories of those species that allowed them then to optimize these trade-offs between what
35:46
is available and what they need now
Research on Biogeography
35:52
unfortunately producing research on biodiversity biogeography has become a lot more complicated in recent times
35:59
mostly because of this issue of novelty today there are tons of papers like for instance when you look at patterns of
36:05
species richness and you go to google and find out how much is known about this you will find that there are over 400 000 papers already on my species
36:12
richness in body size there are sixty thousand papers in abundance they are already over ninety thousand papers so
36:18
there is an incredible amount of information and that is already out there
36:24
making it super hard for us to now publish new papers again related to this issue of novelty again it has become
36:31
very hard to find new insights into this biodiversity however that's not to say
36:36
that there are new papers and in fact there are tons of papers coming out every year but those new papers are not
36:41
necessarily new the description of new patterns or new processes but rather the
36:48
interpretation and critical observation of what we already know let me give you an example for instance of two examples
36:53
that i find remarkable about how new research and biogeography is done you look at these two squares here i
37:00
want you to pause this video in a moment and tell me whether they overlap or not
37:06
so it's very likely that many of you will say yes they overlap you can clearly see an area here where the two
37:11
squares overlap now if i add another dimension to these squares you will
37:17
realize that they don't overlap at all this interesting reinterpretation of
37:22
data was a paper that was published back in the 1980s and thanks to this critical
37:27
contribution this guy managed to resolve a huge controversy that was back in the day regarding the issue of niche
37:34
basically the fact that we had a species living in the same places and when species live in the same places and use
37:39
the same resources you will think that they will compete and eventually they will try to extinction themselves but
37:45
when you look in nature it turns out that the species were able to coexist so that is crazy
37:51
back in the day how is it that two species use the same resources they live in the same place how is it that they
37:57
are not driving themselves to extinction what this guy managed to explain here is that
38:02
sometimes by adding another dimension as you look at the things you find that these species actually don't interact
38:08
for instance in this case he provided an example like some species might use that resource during the day the other
38:13
species might use the resource at night as a result they find species are found in the same place using the same
38:19
resources but they never interact with each other that's a way in which now a species can coexist
38:24
and in this case there was an interesting insight that kind of helped out resolve a
38:29
controversy that was there back in the day another interesting source of
38:35
information that is linked to a lot of papers today is critical observation
38:41
i want you to look at this photograph unfortunately i couldn't find a better photograph this is the only one that i found but what it is it's just a shoe
38:47
and there is a coral attached to it i'm going to take a moment pause this video and think what did you make out of this
38:55
now the reality is that many of us probably will not make much of it you know you go and see that shoe it looks just like
39:01
garbage and there is a squirrel attached to it doesn't look like much well it turns out that back in the 1990s
39:06
here in hawaii was this guy walking on the beach probably in waikiki his name was peter joe
39:12
and he saw this so what he did was again critical observation that neither one of
39:17
us now managed to do so it turns out that back in the day there was this big controversy on how is
39:23
it that some species of corals are found in the caribbean when we know that they originated in the pacific
39:31
so the idea came out that maybe what happened was that corals originated on those two different places and that
39:37
didn't make any sense because probabilistically it's impossible it's almost impossible for life to emerge on
39:43
two different places the idea of evolution is that we all come from a common ancestor so
39:48
unfortunately we just couldn't explain why was it that corals were in the caribbean where there is no way for
39:54
those corals to get there via their the normal mechanisms of this person huge controversy people were going at it
40:01
like you guys cannot imagine peter joe killed waltz on the page she's achieving a cola and what he discovers
40:07
here is that then these corals are capable of attaching to devices that float in the oceans as a result these
40:14
corals can move everywhere around the world dropping off their babies everywhere so thanks to this critical
40:20
observation of something that was staring at the eyes of everybody he managed to resolve an issue that was
40:25
going on for years there and here again is some insights on how new information is
40:31
being generated in biogeography these days here's another example that i want you
The Sixth Sense
40:37
to think about this is a movie that i saw back in the day that i found remarkable this is a movie called the
40:42
sixth sense if you haven't seen it unfortunately i'm gonna ruin it for you but this movie i
40:47
find very interesting because in this movie and they show bruce willis early on in the
40:53
movie he's in his in his bedroom and somebody comes from run out of the bathroom and it shoots
40:59
breeze a bruce willis it turns out that the guy who shoot bruce willis was a patient of his that is sent to a place
41:06
where people crazy people live and because this guy was used to see dead people and bruce willis said that
41:13
the guy was crazy was sent to jail for life anyway after that the movie starts by bruce willis
41:20
helping this kid that can see the people and the entire movie is about bruce
41:25
willis helping the kid cope with his problem that he can see their people and you can see bruce willis going out with
41:31
to dinner with his friends and the entire movie is just about bruce willis interacting
41:37
with the kid at the end of the movie i'm not joking one minute before the end of the movie you can see bruce willis wife
41:43
wearing his ring and you realize during that during the entire movie bruce willis was dead
41:49
that to me is mind-blowing and it's a beautiful example of this issue of reinterpretation again going back to
41:56
biogeography today we see patterns and we make sense autospires and those parents make sense to us quite a lot
42:03
but the beauty of it is that you can come up with a different way to interpret this and the same evidence
42:09
that we have used before could be used to now see parents in a completely different way just like in those in this
42:15
movie during the entire movie you think that bruce willis was alive just to come to realize one minute before the end
42:22
that bruce willis was actually dead all along you go back and analyze all of the evidence it made a lot of
42:28
sense that the guy was dead all along so again the same thing could potentially happen in biogeography in the sense that
42:35
we have parents and processes and it could be matter of just somebody coming along and again as i explained before
42:40
having a critical interpretation critical observation or reinterpretation of what we see that
42:46
will potentially change the way in which we see nature today
The Amount of Sampling
42:52
unfortunately if you were to do research on biogeography you are going to be facing a lot of different issues let's
42:58
just go through some of them the first issue is the amount of sampling we already established that there are different ways that you do sampling
43:05
unfortunately when you start sampling biodiversity you will discover that when you start counting for instance the
43:11
number of species as you are aria you find this very fascinating pattern that is called the species are your
43:16
relationship basically as you increase the amount of area that you sample the number of species start increasing
43:23
but there is a point in which the number of species flattens what it means with this then is that if
43:28
you want to sample how many species are in a given place you need to calculate this optimum sample size so there are
43:35
mathematical equations up there that allow you to calculate what is the minimum sample size that you need to
43:40
count the actual number of species unfortunately this is something that is not done commonly as a result a lot of
43:46
the knowledge that we had today would potentially be biased because of the fact that we haven't sampled many places
43:52
to the optimum level the other issue is about the location
Location
43:58
well it turns out that a species they live over many places and you need to ensure that whenever you do your sampling the sampling that you include
44:05
as as you try to describe patterns or processes is representative of the entire area that the species live in and
44:12
again that's another issue that in biogeography why we don't deal quite well in the fact that many times we
44:18
don't even know where the data comes from when we put these these patterns together
Standardization
44:25
another issue is the standardization of the data you hear commonly on scientific papers that we always try to standardize
44:31
data so that we can compare apples to apples unfortunately sometimes the standardization of data leads to
44:37
potential errors let me give you some examples let's imagine that you have a site
44:42
and in that site there is the background species area relationship that you have here say that you take a sample and you
44:50
try to standardize then the number of species by the area that you sample in this case you will get a certain ratio
44:56
but if you toggle the amount of area that you sample because the saturation of the species
45:02
reach that you ended up with a completely different ratio again here the ratio probably is going to be a lot
45:07
larger because you have a smaller area that you sample here the ratio is going to be a lot smaller
45:14
because you sample a larger area so as you can appreciate here for the same site
45:20
this standardization by aria can give you completely different results but the other day you have the same number of
45:26
species but you get two different values here again a potential issue of the way that you standardize the data a way to
45:33
deal with this is commonly to linearize this line using
45:38
different logarithmic skills and that sometimes resolves this issue there
45:44
here's another example something that you commonly hear in scientific papers is that we always try to use the same
45:50
number of samples everywhere so that we can compare equally different places well it don't know that again for the
45:55
species ideal relationship something that isn't actually not quite correct let me give you an example
46:01
if you go to a place at a high latitude and again you sample the area it turns out that in in the higher latitudes you
46:08
need a very small area sample for you to count all of the species there because there are not a lot of species to begin
46:13
with now you go to the tropics it turns out that the area that you need is a lot larger so now you try to use the same
46:20
number of samples to compare high latitudes to the tropics it turns out that you ended up with a unbalanced
46:26
representation of the species from those places a higher latitudes a smaller sample
46:33
will perhaps be sufficient to identify all of these species that are there but the same amount of sampling area could
46:38
potentially be insufficient in the tropics so again a potential issue as you try to
46:44
standardize data one solution to this problem that has been resolved that have been suggested is the use of asymptotic
46:50
lines so that you use an area that allows you to capture all of the
46:56
species of this place so what you are trying to compare really if you are complaining one place to another is the total number of species on those places
47:02
rather than the number of species in certain amount of area because as i explained here you can get completely different
47:08
values in different places another issue that is commonly found on
Sampling Timing
47:15
biogeography is the timing of the sampling let me just give you an example let's imagine that you want to measure
47:20
temperature in the galapagos island and let's say that you go there only during the summer and you say i'm gonna sample
47:26
temperature three times but it's only one summer so what you're gonna find is that the temperature of galapagos
47:31
islands is pretty hot well no it's not surprising you went during the summer so
47:36
now an alternative sampling is you go maybe every summer every time that you have a break you go and do research in
47:42
the galapagos island you measure temperature the temperature is gonna be pretty hot it's gonna be some variability because you have now three
47:48
summers but it's still not gonna be a representation real representation of the temperature in galapagos so most
47:54
commonly the best suggestion is to use sampling that is random so that again
47:59
potentially you can capture the real patterns that you are trying to measure
48:05
again so here is another issue as it relates to the timing when do you do the sampling to assess not only patterns but
48:12
the drivers or those patterns here is another example about the timing
48:17
of when you do the sampling so biological systems we know that they are viable so let's imagine for a moment
48:24
that this red line here is the number of species on a place and that blue line is the temperature of the same place so
48:32
you depending on the timing in which you monitor the pattern and the process let's say that you sample on a very
48:38
short term so in this example here you you find that the temperature of the one place can get very cold or very hot but
48:45
during that time there was no change in the biodiversity of the place so you can conclude them
48:51
that there is no temperature doesn't influence the species because while the population change sorry while the
48:57
temperature changed the population did not right so in this example by us using
49:03
data that is short term you can conclude that some bios might not be important now if instead you use a long-term
49:10
sampling what you will find is that at times any tip that you find in biodiversity
49:15
coincides with a deep in temperature and while there is some variability in the temperature itself it turns out that
49:21
there is some level of concordance between the two things so again that's another issue that is commonly
49:26
found in biogeography is the time when we do the sampling sometimes you see conclusions
49:32
that that reject the importance of certain variables and many times it could be
49:38
just simply the fact that those bibles haven't been sampled on the right times
Scale
49:43
the other issue again when you that you see commonly identifying
49:49
biogeography is the issue of a scale let me give you an example of this issue of scale let me take a problem
49:55
the problem is i want to move from point a to point b okay but what i'm gonna do is change the scale of the problem
50:02
so if i want to move from point a to point b that's my problem what would be my solution well if my point a is here
50:08
and my point b is there probably the best solution is just to walk right that is skill of here to there the
50:15
solution is well now if i change the skill and now i make point a the bed in
50:20
my house and the background of my house well at that scale maybe walking is still a suitable solution
50:26
if i now change the skill of the problem i came moving from one place to another but now point a is the first floor and
50:33
point b is the second floor of sanders hall you will realize now that there are different solutions that could be
50:38
potentially better like taking the elevator now if point a is manoa and point b is
50:44
ykk again it's the same problem moving from one place to another i'm just changing the scale in this case example
50:50
you realize that maybe walking is not a solution anymore if i may point a honolulu and point b
50:57
that is at that skill walking is certainly not a solution anymore
51:02
so that is something that you see commonly quite commonly not only on biogeography
51:07
but in conservation this issue of us taking data out of very small scales and try to extrapolate that data at a global
51:15
scale and unfortunately what happens is that you find bibles that might be super important at one scale that are completely irrelevant
51:22
at other skills so that is another issue that is common to biogeography again
51:27
this mismatch between patterns and processes and the skills at which those patterns and processes are
51:34
analyzed now there are also
Cellular Replication
51:39
statistical analysis as you start comparing or trying to identify what are the drivers of parents
51:45
one common statistical analysis is what is called cellular replication cellular replication is basically samples that
51:52
are not necessarily independent from each other let me just give you an example here let's imagine that i had two aquariums and in one aquarium i had
52:00
a control and in the other aquarium i increased the temperature and i find that no fish die here but most of the
52:07
fish die here are 35 so my conclusion is that the fish die at 35 degrees and my
52:13
sample size is a thousand individuals in this case my conclusion is biased because it's seldom replicated these
52:20
1000 individuals that i use to make the calculation
52:25
are cellular replications basically i took all the fish from the same aquarium
52:31
so ideally you want to have maybe different aquariums on different places so that when you make a conclusion the
52:36
conclusion is robust meaning that the samples are actually independent from each other in this case all of these
52:42
fish are exposed to the same aquarium the same water so they are not necessarily independent so your conclusion based on those fish is not
52:49
robust despite the fact that you use tons of fish the reason being that they are super replicated for instance you
52:55
can imagine this aquarium being closer to a window that gets exposed to sunlight so now you're exposing those fish to normally temperature but
53:01
sunlight at the same time they die at a slower lower temperature so that is again cellular replication
53:09
there are multiple issues that result from that cellular replication and there is a paper here by
53:15
this guy holberg that i invite you to check out you are interested in better understanding this
53:21
issue of cell door replication the other statistical issue that is
Selfcorrelation
53:26
commonly found on the scientific literature as it deals with biogeography is what is called self-correlation let me just give you an
53:32
example imagine that i take a bible that is completely random and i relate a bible
53:38
to another bible that is completely random as you can expect they don't relate at all here is an example of
53:43
something that i did in excel and you can see that the two variables are not correlated with each other obviously they are random why would they be
53:49
related to each other now it turns out that one thing that you find commonly is people trying to standardize these
53:55
viables and commonly they standardize the variables by arya in which in that
54:00
case if i standardize these two by the same area what i find now is that the two variables are highly correlated to
54:06
each other now despite the fact that they are in principle not related at all the reason
54:12
why they become related to each other is because they are standardized by the same variable on both axes and that is
54:18
what is called self-correlation so correlation again is when you have multiple variables that you are analyzed
54:25
analyzing that are sometimes standardized by by a common bio that obviously results in the bio being
54:31
similar to each other not because they relate to each other but because they are being standardized by a common
54:36
variable another statistical issue that you will see commonly is multicollinearity
Multicollinearity
54:43
let me just give you an example imagine that you have two predictors like for instance rainfall and humidity you can
54:48
assume that the two vials are related so when it rains the humidity goes up when it doesn't rain the humidity goes down
54:54
let's imagine that i had a response viable let's say specie richness and i want to find out for instance if a
55:00
species richness is affected by rainfall my expectation is that whenever
55:06
it rains places that rain a lot there are going to be a lot of species places in which it doesn't rain there is not
55:12
going to be many species and indeed i find that my predictor 1 explains certain amount of the variance of my response bible
55:20
unfortunately because predictor 1 is related to predictor 2 it turns out that then predictor 2 has to explain some
55:26
variance that is already explained by predictor 1. that is what is called again multicoloniality and that is an
55:34
issue that is found very commonly in biogeography especially on papers that analyze analyze only one bible so you
55:40
find very commonly people providing explanations for patterns based on just one bible it turns out
55:46
that you might at times find that the one bio is significant not necessarily because that one bible causes the
55:52
pattern but because there is another bible that correlates to your independent bible that in in turn
55:58
influences your response bible that again is what is called multicollinearity again is when when
56:04
multiple independent bibles are related to each other and that has been identified in a paper
56:11
by graham is one of the major sources of us having potentially grown conclusions
56:17
about what are the drivers of biodiversity let me summarize the entire class
Summary
56:23
the ultimate goal of biogeography is to publish in different papers obviously we want to leave
56:28
an evidence a greeting evidence that the research was done the way in which we do
56:33
recession biogeography again you choose a system that you want to study within the system you look at an attribute you
56:39
obtain the data bill the parent test hypothesis and you finish publishing your paper we identified what that was
56:45
the process is simple there are multiple problems here regarding data reliability
56:50
the way in which the patterns are constructed like for instance the way in which the data is standardized when we
56:56
are testing hypotheses we might encounter numerous statistical issues like the right skills collinearities
57:02
outdoor replication and self-correlation that's it for today let me just summarize the class
57:09
today we look at the attributes that are important there
57:15
for life we then move into understanding why is it that biogeography is important
57:20
and we highlighted the biogeography it's important that the species are important not only in terms of the right to be
57:26
here but in the fact that they produce goods and services that are important for humanity biogeography is the field that studies
57:33
the distribution of those species in space and time that biogeography is important for us for instance to
57:39
preserve those species in the second part of the class we also look at how is
57:44
it that people do biogeography research and we describe again the general process and some of the limitations and
57:51
that's the class for today i see you guys in the next episode
57:59
wow
