[["index.html", "Welcome", " GEO309 Introduction to BioGeography by Camilo Mora, Ph.D. Welcome LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of the class, students are expected to describe spatial patterns on the number of species, body size and abundance on Earth, as well as the driving forces behind those patterns. This course explores current ideas and theory regarding the patterns and mechanisms driving biodiversity on Earth. Student will first gain basic understanding of general concepts about biodiversity, and then dive into current knowledge about global scale patterns on the distribution of species, their body sizes and abundances. We will also discuss how environmental, ecological and anthropocentric variables have shaped such patterns of life on Earth. This course consists of a number of weekly lectures covering different aspects about the diversity of life on Earth. Each lecture has been recorded and is provided in the chapters below. Each chapter is accompanied with the slides of the lectures, and a set questions you need to answer after watching the lectures. Sillabus "],["roadmap-style.html", "Your Roadmap in this Class", " Your Roadmap in this Class Here I explain your expected work in this course; the following page, provides extended details about how this work translates to your grade for this class. Phase A: Submitting Weekly Q&amp;A This determines your grade up to a B+. Each week, by the end of Sunday, you have to submit the Q&amp;A report of a chapter. You are welcome to submit more if you wish to work ahead. I expect that you would expend quality time in this phase, which is the reason why I gave such a high proportion of the grade to it. I recommend using Chrome, Edge or Firefox to submit your weekly Q&amp;A reports (avoid Safari). One-Time Setup: Get your Google API Key and save it in the iStudy App (Instructions below). The Workflow: Chapter Selection: This course has 13 chapters numbered in the Table of Contents on the left sidebar (e.g., 1:, 2:); click the current week’s chapter. Get Questions: On the chapter page, click the “Exam questions” link to see the specific list of questions you need to answer. Watch &amp; Answer: Watch the lecture video located on that same page and collect the answers as you watch. The lecture contains all the information needed to respond to the questions. Submit to iStudy: Save your answers as a file (e.g., Text, or photo of your handwritten responses). Upload that file to the iStudy App (link provided in the Table of Contents on the left sidebar). The iStudy app will provide feedback and generate a revised version of your responses for your records. Submission Rules: Single File Only: You can only upload one file per chapter (containing all answers for the given chapter). File Type: A photo of your handwriting OR a plain text file (.txt). If using Word/Excel: Click “Save As” and select “Plain Text (.txt)” before uploading. If you choose to submit handwritten responses, please ensure they are organized and legible. Clearly mark each question number, leave ample white space between responses, and keep your text in straight, orderly lines. While the application is powerful, it cannot accurately transcribe handwriting that is illegible or disorganized. Required Labeling: Your file must clearly state the Chapter Number and Question Numbers. WARNING the iStudy app will download your revised responses to your computer. Save that file as you will need it as proof that you did the work, and as your study guide, if you chooce to take the exam. Example of the required formatting for your submissions.  Critical: Budget 60 minutes of continuous time to deliver your Q&amp;A report. Due to privacy issues, the app does not save progress; if you stop, you must start from the beginning of that chapter. Phase B: Submitting Exam Videos The exam is voluntary to reach the A territory (A-, A, or A+). These videos are due any time after you finish Phase A and before the last day of class. The Workflow: Preparation: Study your Revised Response Reports from Phase A until you master the logic. Record (One Video Per Chapter): Film yourself responding to all questions for that chapter. You choose which chapters to record. Format: Facing the camera, state the question clearly (this you can read from a paper or your computer screen), then provide the response from memory (for the response you cannot use any external help; that will be seen as cheating). Integrity: No notes allowed; this is an oral proof of mastery. If I suspect cheating, you may be asked to re-do the videos. Validation: If your responses are incorrect, it may indicate Phase A was not completed properly, and you may be asked to provide evidence of your weekly Q&amp;A reports. Delivery: Upload: Post your videos to YouTube (Public or Unlisted). Email: Send the URL links to Dr. Mora. Subject Line: GEO309-[YOUR LAST NAME]-Final exam Email Body: State clearly what you sent and the grade you aim for. For example, “I want an A+, so I am submitting 10 videos showing my mastery of 10 chapters.” WARNING You should create one video per lecture and submit which ever many for the grade that you want. Use the Grading page to check how many chapters you need to submit for the grade you desire. "],["grading.html", " Grading", "  Grading Your grade in this class is transparent and proportional to the content you master in this class. It follows the image below. To read the image, check for instance, that to get an B+ you need to deliver all 13 weekly Q&amp;A reports via the app, you may choose a B and that requires to submit at least 12 chapters, etc. If you choose to take the exam, you need to submit excellent videos with all the responses for six chapter for an A-, eight chapters for an A, and 10 chapters for an A+. Each week as you deliver your Q&amp;A reports, the app will display your current grade.

Follow the steps below: Caution: If you fail to collect tha API key after following the isntructions below, we came across a couple of issues: Restricted Gmail account: If you see any wording to this fact, try a different account or create a new one in the USA. UH accounts do not work. Suspicius request: This warning appears in Apple computers with some browsers. Simply use a different browser. If you follow the instructions below and still fail to get the API, take a screenshot of the website where you hit a roadblock, paste it in Gemini or chatGPT, and write “Help me get a Google AI studio API key. I am stuck in the current page. What do I need to do next? Be brief and give me a solution I can do now” You will do this only once, as the key(s) get saved in your local browser. Go to Google AI Studio: Visit aistudio.google.com and log in with your personal Gmail account (UH emails do not work). Create a Project: 2.1 Click on “Projects” (top left). 2.2 Click “+ Create a new project”. On the popup window, name your project “GEO309” and click “Create project”. Generate the Key: 3.1 Click Get API key (bottom left button). 3.2 Click Create API key. On the popup window, select the GEO309 project you just created. Click “Create key”. Copy &amp; Paste: Copy the generated key string. 4.2 Go to the iStudy app, click the Settings (⚙️) icon, and paste your key, and save it. Note: Ideally, generate 2 or 3 keys using different personal Google accounts and add them all to the app settings. This prevents “Quota Limit” errors during long review sessions.
