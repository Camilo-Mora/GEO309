[["index.html", "Welcome", " GEO309 Introduction to BioGeography by Camilo Mora, Ph.D. Welcome Welcome to Introduction to BioGeography. This course explores current ideas and theory regarding the patterns and mechanisms driving biodiversity on Earth. Student will first gain basic understanding of general concepts about biodiversity, and then dive into current knowledge about global scale patterns on the distribution of species, their body sizes and abundances. We will also discuss how environmental, ecological and anthropocentric variables have shaped such patterns of life on Earth. This course consists of a number of weekly lectures covering different aspects about the diversity of life on Earth. Each lecture has been recorded and is provided in the chapters below. Each chapter is accompanied with the slides of the lectures, and a set questions you need to answer after watching the lectures. Sillabus "],["grading.html", "Grading", " Grading At the core of providing a grade in any course is to ensure that the grade you get is proportional to how well you learned the content of the class. A person with an A+ is expected to answer correctly to any question about the material shown in the course. In this class, I have wanted for my grading to be transparent, in the sense that you should be able to know exactly the grade that you will get in my class. For this, I have removed a lot of uncertainty in the questioningI have provided the list of questions I will ask in the final test, so if you know the answers you will know your exact grade. In any other course, a teacher can ask tens of questions in different forms about the content of the course. In my class the questions are set and provided in advance. So there should be not uncertainty on what and how questions are: you know the questions in advance. I hope you make the most of this opportunity. Please do not ask me for the answers to the questions. Just think whether any other class you have ever taken gave you the questions of the exam in advance. That is a huge opportunity, so please do not exaggerate the magnitude of the request by asking for the responses as well. Those responses are for you to find as you go over the content of the course. AS you watch the content of the course and find the responses to the questions, please brianstorm your responses with your partner as suggested in this book. This will ensure you will get the best answers you can. Weekly Assignments (20%) Each week Friday (or any day earlier if you like), you need to deliver your responses to the questions of the weekly chapters. You need to work on these questions and responses with another student. Your responses to these questions need to be delivered to me by email; after you email the responses, you need to sign up the attendance sheet, which I will be providing by email to you at the beginning of the course. Below I provide instructions about these weekly assignments. These weekly assignments will be worth 20% of your grade. Final exam (80%) In a time slot during the last two weeks of the semester, you will meet with me to take the final exam of the class. The final exam will be based in exactly the same questions provided in your weekly assignments; your welcome. If you fail the final test, you will be allowed to take it again, without any penalty to your grade. This test will be worth 80% of your grade. Below, I provide more instructions about the test. "],["weekly-assignments.html", "Weekly Assignments", " Weekly Assignments Each lecture is accompanied with a given number of questions, for which groups of two students (you and another student) need to find the answers during or after watching the video of the given lecture. I suggest the following approach to watching the videos and finding the answers: Individual work: Read the questions for the given lecture. Watch the video of the given lecture (I recommend that you keep track of the times in the videos where answers are located so you can easily come back to them later on, if needed). Respond to each question in a Word or Excel File. Group work: Meet with your partner, compare the responses to each question, and select a unique response. Deliver your responses in a chain email (see more instruction below) to cmora@hawaii.edu (either direct text email, or add as an attachment your Word or Excel file). These assignments are due each week Friday or any day earlier if you like. Fill the attendance sheet for the given lecture. Done. INSTRUCTIONS TO DELIVER YOUR WEEKLY ASSIGMENTS: Follow the following instructions to email your assignments (I will penalize students a 5% of the grade for not following these instructions). Take it as a learning experience and let me give you my reasoning: Imagine that you just got hired in a new job and your boss tells you to run a test in a very expensive machine; she also suggests that you have a look at the instructions to operate the machine. Say that you scan quickly, or perhaps did not even read the instructions, thinking that the machine is easy to operate. You turned the machine ON, which triggers a fire inside the machine. It turns out that the instructions cautioned to check the water level of the machine before it is turned On. The failure to read the instructions carefully just ruined a very expensive machine, and I am confident that your boss will not be happy. I am cautioning this because it has been my experience that some, not all, students in online courses pay little to no attention to the instructions, which results in unnecessary stress for everyone. Also, if you ask questions whose answers are provided in the instructions, it implies that you did not read the instructions with the necessary care. Please do not hesitate to ask questions if you cannot really figure it out, but please make the effort to read in advance the instructions that have been provided. With that said, here are the instructions to deliver your assignments: How to email the first assignment: Step 1. In the subject, write GEO309 Assignments by (Your Name) and (Your partners name). Only you or your partner should deliver the assignment. Step 2. In the first line of text of the email, indicate the lecture number (e.g., Lecture 1). Step 3. Load your answers (either load the file with the answers or write them down after line 2 of your email) Step 4. Send the email with copy to cmora@hawaii.edu and your partners email. Step 5. Fill the attendance sheet (that is, put the date in front of your name for the given lecture) Done. How to email the second to last assignment (how to send lectures 2 to 13): Step 1. Reply to the email used to deliver the first assignment. Ensure to Reply including all contacts (so that me and your partner are cc). Step 2. In the first line of text of the email, indicate the lecture number (e.g., Lecture 2). Step 3. Load your answers (either load the file with the answers or write them down after line 2 of your email) Step 4. Fill the attendance sheet. Done. In short, I need you to ensure that all your assignments are concatenated in the same email chain, and that you copy your partner and me. This will facilitate assessing your progress, and quickly check the responses if needed. It is mandatory for you to deliver the weekly assignments in collaboration with a partner. This is done because it has been my experience that some students in online courses leave all work to be done the last week of the semester. That put a lot of stress on everyone. This method of you having to work with a partner forces you and your partner to watch the lectures each week. The other benefit is that it allows you to interact with the content of the course beyond simply watching a video. "],["final-exam.html", "Final exam", " Final exam The questions of the exam will be exactly the same questions I have provided for each lecture and for which you delivered weekly assignments. At the end of the semester, I will provide a calendar with time slots for us to schedule the time for you to take the test. The test can be taken any time in the mornings from Monday to Friday during the last two weeks of the semester. We can find an alternative time, if needed. This will be an oral exam. Your grading for this test will be as follow: A week or two before the tests starts, I will provide a GoogleSheets link, where you will mark the questions for which you feel confident you know the answers for. This sheet will give you automatically the grade that you will get in the exam. Before you claim that you know the answer to a question, I suggest you ask the question in loud voice and answer it in also loud voice. If you respond to the question yourselft, you should be able to respond to the question when I ask it. At the time of the exam, I will ask three questions randomly from the questions you claimed you know. If you answer them correctly, I have then confirmed that you indeed knew the answers to the questions you claimed you knew and you will get the grade that appears in the sheet. If you fail to answer any of my questions correctly, that means that your own assessment of the content is incorrect; at this time, I will offer you one of two choices: Option A: I ask you seven more questions out of the total pool of questions. Each correct answer will be 10% of the grade. Your grade for the final exam will be the cumulative number of correct answers you provided. Option B: I offer you to take the test again, in which case you will go back to the GoogleSheet to mark the questions that you really and honestly know the answers for. From the subset of questions you claim you know, I will ask you three questions to confirm that you knew the answers to those questions. You will get the grade that appears in the sheet if you answer the three questions correctly. If after this second chance you fail to answer the three questions correctly, I will ask you seven more questions randomly from the total pool, and your grade will be based on the number of questions you answer correctly. "],["extra-credit.html", "Extra credit", " Extra credit All lectures have been filmed and are posted in the pages below. All pages are loaded with data, and they all follow a general outline that I describe at the start of each lecture. However, I appreciate that watching a video for nearly an hour could be tedious. To motivate you to watch these lectures while paying attention and remaining focus, I have introduced a couple of errors in the lectures. If you identify any of such errors, please email it to me. Pointing any of such errors will give you a 5% buffer in your grade.In your email indicate the error, video number and time when it appears. The errors are simply statements, or terms I made that you should be able to challenge with the data given along the different lectures. These errors are not significant and do not affect any concept, but if you spot them, then you have been paying attention. Please do not reveal the errors to the rest of the class.
