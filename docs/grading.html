<h2>Grading</h2>
<p><strong>Weekly Assignments (20%)</strong></p>
<p>Each week Friday (any time is fine), you need to deliver your responses to the questions of the weekly chapters. You need to work on these questions and responses with another student. Your responses to these questions need to be delivered to me by email following the instructions provided below. These weekly assignments will be worth 20% of your grade.</p>
<p><strong>Final exam (80%)</strong></p>
<p>In a time slot during the last two weeks of the semester, you will meet with me to take the final exam of the class. The final exam will be based in exactly the same questions provided in your weekly assignments; your welcome.</p>
<p>If you fail the final test, you will be allowed to take it again, without any penalty to your grade. This test will be worth 80% of your grade. Below, I provide more instructions about the test.</p>
<div id="weekly-assignments" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Weekly Assignments</h3>
<p>Each lecture is accompanied with a given number of questions, for which groups of two students (you and another student) need to find the answers during or after watching the video of the given lecture.</p>
<p>I suggest the following approach to watching the videos and finding the answers:</p>
<p><strong>Individual work</strong>:
1. Read the questions for the given lecture.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Watch the video of the given lecture (I recommend that you keep track of the times in the videos where answers are located so you can easily come back to them later on, if needed).</p></li>
<li><p>Respond to each question in a Word or Excel File.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Group work</strong>:
4. Meet with your partner, compare the responses to each question, and select a unique response.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Deliver your responses by email to <a href="mailto:cmora@hawaii.edu" class="email">cmora@hawaii.edu</a> (either direct text email, or add as an attachment your Word or Excel file). These assignments are due each week Friday; any time is fine.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS TO DELIVER YOUR WEEKLY ASSIGMENTS</strong>:
Follow the following instructions to email your assignments (I will penalize students a 5% of the grade for not following these instructions). Take it as a learning experience and let me give you my reasoning:</p>
<p>Imagine that you just got hired in a new job and your boss tells you to run a test in a very expensive machine; she also suggests that you have a look at the instructions to operate the machine. Say that you scan quickly, or perhaps did not even read the instructions, thinking that the machine is easy to operate. You turned the machine ON, which triggers a fire inside the machine. It turns out that the instructions cautioned to check the water level of the machine before it is turned On. The failure to read the instructions carefully just ruined a very expensive machine, and I am confident that your boss will not be happy.</p>
<p>I am cautioning this because it has been my experience that some, not all, students in online courses pay little to no attention to the instructions, which results in unnecessary stress for everyone.
Also, if you ask questions, whose answers are provided in the instructions, it implies that you did not read the instructions with the necessary care.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to ask questions if you cannot really figure out, but please make the effort to read in advance the instructions that have been provided. With that said, here are the instructions to deliver your assignments:</p>
<p><strong>First assignment email:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the subject, write “GEO309 Assignments by” (Your Name) “and” (Your partner’s name).</p></li>
<li><p>In the first line of text of the email, indicate the assignment number/lecture number (e.g., Lecture 1).</p></li>
<li><p>After the second line in the body of the email write the responses to each question (or attach a Word or Excel file with your responses)</p></li>
<li><p>Send the email with copy to <a href="mailto:cmora@hawaii.edu" class="email">cmora@hawaii.edu</a> and your partner’s email.</p></li>
<li><p>Done.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Second to last assignment:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Reply to the email used to deliver the first assignment. Ensure to “Reply” including all contacts (so that me and your partner are cc).</p></li>
<li><p>In the first line of text of the email, indicate the assignment number/lecture number (e.g., Lecture 2).</p></li>
<li><p>After the second line in the body of the email write the responses to each question (or attach a Word or Excel file with your responses)</p></li>
<li><p>Done.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In short, I need you to ensure that all your assignments are concatenated in the same email chain, and that you copy your partner and me. This will facilitate assessing your progress, and quickly check the responses if needed.</p>
<p>It is mandatory for you to deliver the weekly assignments in collaboration with a partner. This is done because it has been my experience that some students in online courses leave all work to be done the last week of the semester. That put a lot of stress on everyone. This method of you having to work with a partner forces you and your partner to watch the lectures each week. The other benefit is that it allows you to interact with the content of the course beyond simply watching a video.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-exam" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Final exam</h3>
<p>The questions of the exam will be exactly the same questions I have provided for each lecture and for which you delivered weekly assignments.</p>
<p>At the end of the semester, I will provide a calendar with time slots for us to schedule the time for you to take the test. The test can be taken any time in the mornings from Monday to Friday during the last two weeks of the semester. We can find an alternative time, if needed. This will be an oral exam.</p>
<p>Your grading for this test will be as follow:</p>
<p>A week or two before the tests starts, I will provide a GoogleSheets link, where you will mark the questions for which you feel confident you know the answers for. This sheet will give you automatically the grade that you will get in the exam.</p>
<p>At the time of the exam, I will ask three questions randomly from the questions you claimed you know. If you answer them correctly, I have then confirmed that you indeed knew the answers to the questions you claimed you knew and you will get the grade that appears in the sheet. If you fail to answer any of my questions correctly, that means that your own assessment of the content is incorrect; at this time, I will offer you one of two choices:</p>
<p><strong>Option A</strong>: I ask you seven more questions out of the total pool of questions. Each correct answer will be 10% of the grade. Your grade for the final exam will be the cumulative number of correct answers you provided.</p>
<p><strong>Option B</strong>: I offer you to take the test again, in which case you will go back to the GoogleSheet to mark the questions you <em>really and honestly</em> know the answers for. From the subset of questions you claim you know, I will ask you three questions to confirm that you knew the answers to those questions. You will get the grade that appear in the sheet if you answer the three questions correctly.
If after this second chance you fail to answer the three questions correctly, I will ask you seven more questions randomly from the total pool, and your grade will be based on the number of questions you answer correctly.</p>
